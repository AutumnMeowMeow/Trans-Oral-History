He grew up in Buffalo, New York in a working-class family in the hood, Milan states. He loves his family, and he had a pretty good childhood. His mom was a nurse, and his father was a mechanic. They divorced when Milan was 3, but his parents maintained a good relationship. His father lived around the corner and would come over for dinner. Milan has 3 older sisters. He went to a private Catholic school his entire life. He was a tomboy as a kid. In high school he became more feminine since that was the expectation at his school that focused on developing womanhood. He played basketball and volleyball all through high school. He went to Niagara University in Lewiston, New York with a full D1 basketball scholarship, but the coaches and others there were racist and treated him badly, leading him to give up on his dreams of going pro. He came out as a lesbian at 14 and got involved in the queer community. His mom didn’t take it well at first, but she is now one of Milan’s biggest supporters of his trans identity. He remembers being feminine and attracting masculine women. He knew masculinity wasn’t something that he was attracted to, however, but it was something that he wanted for himself. He graduated high school in 1998. His graduation was the last time he ever wore feminine clothes. After that he began to develop his masculinity again. He moved to New York City for grad school where he bartended, drank, and got into drugs. While he was there he identified as a stud and then as a butch, which left him feeling confused because something didn’t feel right, something was missing. He later came into his trans masculine identity when he encountered a white trans man in 2004 or 2005 while bartending at a lesbian bar called Meow Mix. That was the moment where he realized transitioning was possible. In 2007 he started on low doses of T and came out as trans in 2010 when he had top surgery. He’s also had a double mastectomy and chest reconstruction. He also wants to have a hysterectomy, but his insurance denied him a year ago at the time of the interview. He is now married to his wife, a cis gender, queer identified woman, and they have a baby on the way. He was a keynote speaker at the University of Minnesota’s Power & Privilege series where he gave a talk on “Redefining Masculinity.” He’s worked at Lambda Legal, GLAAD, GLSEN, the Hetrick-Martin Institute, the Bronx Community Pride Center, and he’s on the board for the National Anti-Violence Project.

138,Satin_Barbara,"Satin, Barbara","Jenkins, Andrea",10/13/2015,"Barbara Satin is a bisexual trans woman assigned male at birth. She was born in 1934 as the youngest of four kids and raised Catholic in St. Paul, Minnesota. Since her father died when she was a baby, her mother raised her with the financial support of her two uncles. She grew up with feelings of liking feminine things, which made her feel good, excited, and wonderful, but she hid these feelings since no one around her talked about those things. As a result, she became macho to prove herself as a man, eventually becoming a jet pilot in the Air Force. She went to a conservative Catholic preparatory seminary school for two years during high school where she saw this girl in an outfit Satin loved. Satin knew then that her feelings around gender weren’t going away. She graduated from Cretin High School, went to St. Thomas College, joined the Air Force, and married a woman believing that would resolve her feelings around gender. She also had three kids, a successful 30-year business career as Public Relations Director for St. Paul Companies, which is now Travelers, and a lovely home and church life. She was even asked to run for mayor of St. Paul, but she didn’t want to open the opportunity for others to discover her gender identity issues. She took an early retirement, and then one day her son asked to talk. Her son told her she was different, more harsh and critical. He asked her what was going on, and she decided then to come out to him as transgender, something she never did before. Her son placed a hand on hers, and told her, “Dad, we’ve been waiting for you to tell us.” Her wife, on the other hand, was not as open to the idea, and she said, “I wouldn’t want anything like that in my life.” Her son, a psychotherapist himself, suggested therapy to Satin. She went, and it helped her overcome her negative attitude towards her identity. She was a member and later president of the City of the Lakes Crossgender Community, CLCC, where you had to swear secrecy and get references to join. After the 1993 Human Rights Protection for GLBT passed, however, it gave the trans community the right to be more public and open. Growing up Catholic, she never divorced but she left the marriage and her church, which was challenging. She moved to Brooklyn Park and found Spirit of the Lakes Church, a GLBT church, which led her into her work within UCC, the United Church of Christ as the first trans woman in leadership as the chairman of the board. Satin has now returned to her wife who now struggles with arthritis and hand tremors. Her wife acknowledges Satin now for who she is, but she also isn’t entirely supportive. She’s done advocacy work for trans issues, even performing a piece on stage about her trans identity in Chicago after a worship service. She was recently promoted Deputy Faith Work Director for the National LGBTQ Task Force. She’s served the LGBT community as well by being on the board of OutFront, PFund, GLBT Generations, Training to Serve, and Clare Housing.","Bisexual Trans Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Catholic; St. Paul, Minnesota; Feminine; Jet Pilot; Air Force; St. Thomas College; Marriage; Public Relations Director; Business Career; Coming Out; Therapy; Clcc; City of the Lakes Crossgender Community; 1993 Human Rights Protection for Glbt; Spirit of the Lakes Church; Ucc; United Church of Christ; Advocacy Work; Trans Issues; National Lgbtq Task Force; Out Front; P Fund; Glbt Generations; Training to Serve; Clare Housing",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:100

He has two sisters and went to the Meher School, a Sufism school, which is connected to Islam and mysticism. His parents weren’t practitioners, but they accepted him into the school as a student. He was a tomboy in the 1980s wearing boy’s clothes and was fairly socially accepted. He began dressing more feminine in middle school and high school, but by the end of high school he wore boy’s clothes again and cut off his hair. He first heard the word transgender in high school but didn’t understand how it related to him or its meaning. He always knew he was different from the general white suburban environment that he was in but didn’t had the language to fully articulate how he was different. He flew under the radar at school and had a good group of friends that he hung out with. In high school he understood he wasn’t good at heterosexuality as a way of being since he didn’t do well in those settings. He had a boyfriend and then a girlfriend in high school, both pretty private relationships. He knew he wasn’t straight and identified as bisexual and then as a dyke both as a gender identity and as a sexuality for a period in his life, associating the term dyke with masculinity. He was called a faggot by others, being seen as a gay guy, during that time in his life. He is attracted to masculine people and to men. He went to Minneapolis Community and Technical College for nursing where he began transitioning. Medically and socially transitioning freed up a lot of his time and energy that he once directed inward but now directed outwards. He’s now a registered nurse and does home hospice. Initially his family wasn’t accepting of his trans identity, but they are now and they have a good relationship. He had top surgery and has been on testosterone for about 5 years since the time of the interview. He is currently filing a complaint against his employer because they are trans exclusive in their health insurance benefit package. He used to work for RECLAIM while he was going to nursing school.

She was assigned female at birth and is an only child. He grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and went to Catholic school. Senseman’s mother was emotionally abusive and her father worked all the time. As a result, Senseman spent a lot of time at his grandmother’s place who lived next door. Her father was sick and afraid of leaving Senseman without the masculine skills to survive, so he taught her a lot about how to fix and build things growing up. Senseman was a tomboy growing up in the 1980s, playing sports and hanging out with boys. When he went to college at Bucknell he realized there was something different about his gender. From a young age, he felt the way he looked wasn’t right, and it wasn’t until college when he cut his hair short that he felt he was coming into himself. His parents stayed together until his father died. Senseman graduated law school in 2003 and landed a job at a progressive firm. The firm, however, wasn’t comfortable making Senseman a partner because there was something different about her, namely her queer identity. He left the firm and now works elsewhere in a more affirming environment. He now has an 8-year-old son and is married to a cis queer woman. She hasn’t had any surgeries to date, but she binds her chest daily. He thinks about top surgery sometimes.

167,Rea_Raymond,"Rea, Raymond","Jenkins, Andrea",10/16/2016,"Raymond Rea was born in the 1960s. He identifies as a queer trans male and was assigned female at birth. He was born in upstate New York and then moved to Concord, Massachusetts, a small middle-to-upper-class suburb of Boston. As a kid he was a tomboy, always wearing more traditionally masculine clothes except on Easter when his mom would stuff him into a dress. He also played outside, running all over the neighborhood and playing kickball and imaginary games out in the woods. He also saw himself as non-sexed, just a kid that’s neither female or male. Around 11 or so he took on the role of an adult male character from a book while his other friends took on other roles as part of their play. That was the first time he felt something was there since he was happy in that character. When he hit puberty, he was miserable. He has memories just lying on the floor crying, and he thought then that the problem was he just didn’t like guys, so he hung out with girls. In college at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan he attempted to be a straight woman sleeping with men while also starting to do a lot of drugs and alcohol. He dropped out of college sophomore year, moved to New York City, and got a job there. He also went one summer session to New York University where he studied cinematography but then decided to move to San Francisco, California when he was 21 in 1981, which was around the beginning of the AIDS epidemic and a few years after the Harvey Milk and George Moscone assassinations. He joined the punk community there when he became a bartender at a local club called The Sound of Music. The punk scene was accepting of queer people and those seen as freaks by society. Shortly after, however, skinheads began to join, resulting in homophobia and AIDS stigma. Hitting rock bottom with drugs and alcohol, he got sober after admitting to himself that he was attracted to women. 12 years later he came out as a trans guy. He had a hysterectomy in 1997 for medical reasons and then top surgery a bit later. He’s also been on hormones since 1997. In San Francisco where he lived for 18 years he felt solidly trans male but, now living in the Fargo area in North Dakota where gender is narrower, he sees himself more as gender fluid and genderqueer. He states that what’s considered male is incredibly narrow. For example, he’s usually seen as a gay man because he doesn’t follow the expected gender behavior of men such as owning cats, gardening, not owning a gun nor hunting, not having a wife nor kids, being single, not drinking, and not being Christian. He is a professor in the film department at Minnesota State University-Moorhead. He’s also a filmmaker and has been involved in many film festivals, screening his films all over the country and the world.","Queer Trans Male; Assigned Female at Birth; Syracuse, New York; Concord, Massachusetts; Boston Suburb; Tomboy; Puberty; University of Michigan; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Addiction; New York City; Cinematography; New York University; San Francisco, California; Aids Epidemic; Harvey Milk; George Moscone; Punk Community; Bartender; The Sound of Music; Skinheads; Queers; Homophobia; Aids Stigma; Sober; Trans Guy; Hysterectomy; Top Surgery; Hormones; Fargo, North Dakota; Gender Fluid; Genderqueer; Narrow Definitions of Masculinity; Professor; Film Department; Minnesota State University Moorhead; Filmmaker",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:104

He was born in South Korea in 1996 and grew up around Hopkins, Minnesota. His birth mother at the time was unwed and escaping a bad marriage. She then met Bates’ father, but their relationship didn’t last since she didn’t trust him. She tried raising Bates but couldn’t make it work as a single mother, so he was put up for adoption. Ever since he was 4 he wanted short hair, would participate in masculine activities, and knew himself to be a boy. As a child in second or third grade he played on the local basketball team where he realized to his disappointment that he wasn’t a boy as he thought he was when the coach told him he needed a protective cup. Believing he was one of the boys, he told his mom he needed a cup, and she laughed. He realized then he wasn’t going to be able to play on the team. He was bullied in school around his race, sexuality, and gender expression. He was called a chink, gook, and other racial slurs related to his eyes. He began to attempt to blend in and act as white as possible, stopped talking about South Korea, and stopped going to cultural events. He came out as gay in junior high but was depressed since he didn’t know who he was even after coming out. Bates figured out that he was trans when a trans man shared his experiences with him and after researching online about it. He then came out as trans when he started high school. His mom was accepting but worried about Bates encountering trans violence and dealing with other trans related issues that she believed would make his life harder. She was concerned about his safety. His dad, on the other hand, responded by saying Bates wasn’t really trans and fell into denial. He finally accepted that Bates was trans when Bates’ therapist from the Program on Human Sexuality told him he was trans, however. His brother accepted him as well but wished bates didn’t have to medically transition, even asking Bates to just socially transition. Because of insurance issues, he’s been off and on testosterone as he waited for prior authorization approval, which put him in danger since it affected his chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. He had a bi-lateral mastectomy as a senior in high school and top surgery. He went to the University of Puget Sound in Washington State as an out trans person. He interned at OutFront Minnesota working with schools and youth and has also been involved in other trans advocacy. He is currently in a relationship with his girlfriend.","Queer Trans Man; Trans Male; Assigned Female at Birth; Adopted; South Korea; Hopkins, Minnesota; Masculine Expression; Basketball; Bullying; Racial Slurs; Coming Out; Gay; Depression; Insurance Denial; Testosterone; Prior Authorization Denial; Chronic Medical Conditions; Diabetes; Bi Lateral Mastectomy; Top Surgery; University of Puget Sound; Washington State; Out Front Minnesota; Trans Advocacy; Relationships",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:106

He has a twin sister and 7 other siblings. He grew up with his grandmother who was his legal guardian. He shared a room with his two sisters and two cousins. His mom came and went, but his dad was around more and would play sports and do after school activities with him. He went to school in Plymouth, Minnesota and Eagan, Minnesota. King also says he grew up around drugs and alcohol at home. He was teased in high school for being emo. He moved to St. Paul, Minnesota at 18 to the Booth Brown House where he met a couple of trans guys. King always knew there was something off about himself since he was the weird one in his family, but it wasn’t until he met these trans guys that he began to explore trans identity by getting new clothes, evaluating who he was, and what he wanted out of life. He didn’t know who he was and began to realize he has his own identity and voice. Before he was deeply depressed and used self-harm to cope, feeling he needed to hide himself as he dealt with feelings of internalized homophobia, transphobia, and racism. He’s found a way to embrace himself, however, even while still feeling awkward. He’s experienced people being uncomfortable around him when he is perceived to be a black man. He’s on testosterone and got top surgery in the past year and half since the interview. His family struggled accepting and believing that King was trans when he came out to them and still struggle gendering him correctly. He knows he would like to have kids someday but is unsure how that is going to look for him. He enjoys writing poetry, doodling, and singing, and works for Super America. He is currently in a relationship with his genderqueer partner of two months and has known them for 5 years. He wants to go to college for psychology or social work.

Wedin doesn’t have any kids, and she’s been married for 9 years now. She cross-dressed in private beginning at the age of 12 or 13 since she wasn’t comfortable sharing it. Since she was young, she recognized that she wanted to be a girl, but she thought the idea was absurd. She kept things about her gender a secret, but other boys targeted her and picked on her. She describes the bind that men often find themselves in: they can’t properly be masculine since they are often humiliated for doing it wrong, but they can’t be feminine either because that’s not allowed. She discovered drama club in high school which was full of queer people and came out as bi to some people then. That experience helped her figure a few things out, and she started to come into her own. She stayed in Long Island until 18. She then moved for college where she met her wife and then moved into an apartment with her in Queens. Wedin dressed openly queer in college, wearing heels and hair accessories or a skirt over jeans. After college, she was too busy with her job to think too much about gender and just referred to herself as a crossdresser. When she came out to her wife, she already knew and was supportive and understanding about her identity. She’s on hormone replacement therapy on spironolactone, estradiol, finasteride, progesterone and uses intense pulsed light to remove hair. She is considering bottom surgery. Now passing as a woman in public, she’s experienced street harassment such as cat calling and men leering at her.

135,Rocero_Geena,"Rocero, Geena","Jenkins, Andrea",11/16/2016,"Geena Rocero was raised in the Philippines and grew up poor in a small neighborhood in the metro city of Makati with three siblings and her parents. Realizing she identified as a girl at 4 or 5 years old, she loved playing with Barbies and having long hair, which was her first idea of femininity. Joining beauty pageants and wrapping towels around her head as a kid helped her feel connected to femininity. Growing up her boy name was June-June, and she loved playing street games outside barefoot. She went to elementary school where her mom worked as a teacher. Her mother was also the breadwinner in the family while her father was a stay-at-home dad who cooked and cleaned. Growing up effeminate, Rocero, even now, is taunted, teased, and harassed by others in the Philippines who provoke fear in her and police her gender expression. She’s also a well-known trans beauty queen in the Philippines. She later immigrated to the United States, living in New York City for ten years as a model. Passionate about reclaiming her indigenous culture, she started an organization called Gender Proud which advocates for Asian-Pacific LGBTQ rights and produces a web series called Beautiful as I Want to Be. She is also an artist, producer, and television host. She had transition related surgery in San Francisco and Thailand and started taking an injectable birth control at 15 or 16 in the Philippines to feminize herself. She moved to San Francisco in 2001 through Asian-Pacific Wellness Center where she was able to properly learn how to inject her own hormones. She also came out on a TedTalk show and was the first trans person Caitlyn Jenner met.","Trans Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Makati, Philippines; Femininity; Beauty Pageants; Effeminate; Bullying; Gender Policing; Immigrant; New York City; Modeling; Indigenous Culture; Gender Proud; Asian Pacific Lgbtq Rights; Transition Related Surgery; San Francisco, Ca; Thailand; Birth Control; Hormones; Asian Pacific Wellness Center; Ted Talk; Caitlyn Jenner",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:111

Growing up shy and uncomfortable in public, she kept to herself, staying away from typical boy-related activities, since it was difficult before coming out to be herself. She was a writer, painter, and artist in grade school and was involved in theater, however. She also lifted weights and took tae kwon do in school to avoid being harassed. Murray came out in 2015 as non-binary and also changed her name publicly. Being non-binary didn’t quite fit, however, and she began to use she/her pronouns. She was denied health care access for bariatric (weight loss) surgery after being asked inappropriate questions about her trans identity to determine if she was mentally stable for surgery. She experienced trans misogyny and policing from within the trans community when she came out. She’s not out to her family yet but plans to come out to them soon. At the time of the interview she didn’t have money to continue laser hair removal, electrolysis, or facial feminization. She is currently on estrogen, spiro, and dutasteride. She was born with a borderline intersexed condition that lessens her sex drive and identifies as bisexual and demisexual, which is on the asexual spectrum.

She identifies herself as a transgender woman assigned male at birth. At 11, Krug’s father was promoted at his job. They consequently moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa where, practically overnight, they were transported from lower to upper middle class and moved to a new, nicer neighborhood. In Cedar Rapids, Krug began crossdressing in her sister’s underwear at 11, despite feeling ashamed of it and hiding it. Krug describes herself as a jock during grade school, playing football, karate, and baseball along with dating girls. She was also bullied during high school by football players, perhaps for standing out too much from men. When Krug started dating a girl who she later married with the expectation to be a man, as an escape she would crossdress in lingerie. Later, afraid her wife would leave her, Krug stuffed down feelings of feminine gender expression for close to 30 years. After Krug’s father committed suicide in 1990, she discovered that he was unfaithful to her mother, having sex with men and women. Krug decided then to commit herself to never be unfaithful to her wife. She tried all sort of strategies, such as multiple therapists and drinking to cope. Krug had a daughter with her wife and planned on adopting another. Krug realized, however, that she could not sacrifice herself anymore for her wife and family after the events of 9/11 acted as a wakeup call for her. It took Krug three difficult years to work up to leaving her wife, her soulmate as Krug describes. In 2009 Krug, at the time a divorced trial lawyer with her own law firm outside Cedar Rapids, came out and began presenting as a woman and socially transitioning. In 2010 she lost her law firm after clients left due to her transition and then, ready for a fresh start, moved to the Twin Cities where she wrote a book, became Executive Director of Call for Justice which helps low-income people with legal resources, and underwent three major transition related surgeries. Her book is a memoir, Getting to Ellen: A Memoir About Love, Honesty, and Gender Change, which speaks to her struggle to find authenticity. The memoir was produced as a stage play in 2015. Krug is on the board of the Minnesota Lavender Bar Association, the largest group of professional queer lawyers in Minnesota. In Iowa City, she was president and then a board member of an organization called Connections, which was LGBTQ education and program oriented. Krug has also given hundreds of talks about being transgender, educating and advocating others about trans identity.","Trans Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Newark, New Jersey; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Crossdressing; Bullying; Suicide; Stealth Identities; Shame; Jock; Coping Strategies; Therapy; Drinking; Trial Lawyer; Social Transition; Twin Cities; Call for Justice; Transition Related Surgeries; Memoir; Minnesota Lavender Bar Association; Connections; Public Speaking; Education; Advocacy; Education",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:116

Meza grew up in a traditional Catholic Mexican-American family with five brothers and six sisters. Their parents raised them to garden, harvest, and live off the land.

They were born in Marietta, Georgia and then moved to a little town called Villa Rica, Georgia when they were around 4 or 5. They grew up with a mother who neglected them. Her mother was a crack cocaine addict, and Concepcion also had an absent father. Concepcion was sexually abused by people who smoked crack with their mother and by their cousins that would bully them and call them a girly boy. As a kid, Concepcion remembers mimicking their sister who is one of their heroes. They wore her skirts and never stood to pee. They ran away from home at 14, and they describe how they met a prostitute who taught them the trade, how to live on the streets, and how to sell drugs.

They started studying for the SAT before starting college at the University of West Georgia in Carrollton, Georgia, which Concepcion describes as a disaster, but they graduated.

He was assigned female at birth and was born in the middle part of East Africa within the border lands of Kenya and Somalia in a small farming village. He immigrated to the United States as a toddler, arriving in New York post 9/11. He just got U.S. citizenship a year previously. He grew up in New York City with his Muslim family. When he entered kindergarten and first grade, he was immediately called towel head, and ever since then he’s had to defend his existence and his right to be here in America. He could not speak, only being able to mumble and make fairly audible sounds, until the age of 7, and he was treated differently as if he wasn’t as intelligent as a result. His speech impediment made assimilating to Minneapolis, Minnesota more difficult when his family moved there. He was derailed for being Muslim, humiliated for having voice issues, lied to about his gender identity, and on top of that, his father discouraged Farah from engaging in masculine pursuits such as math, science, and riding a bike since he was raised to be a girl. Farah worked up the courage to tell others he was a boy, leading to his father telling him he wasn’t “raising no fags” and pulling Farah by the ear, taking him outside where he was paraded around, disciplining him. Farah’s mother defended her child, but his family believed that he was cursed, and his father soon left them. After his father left, Farah was able to express himself more openly as a tomboy, wearing his hijab askew and wearing dirty, ripped jeans. He was teased constantly in school and had a hard time making friends. He then cut his hair and expressed himself as a boy in school. Puberty left him feeling as if he couldn’t fully be a girl but also not a guy either since he didn’t develop fully as either female or male because of his intersex condition called CAH or Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia which affected his gonads and hormone levels. His mother tried various exorcisms to pray the gay away. Failing to do so, his mom kicked him out. He then went into a random café which turned out to be the Minnesota Trans Health Coalition at Café Southside. Roxanne Anderson sat Farah down at Café Southside and helped him find resources through Host Home Project, which is run by Avenues for Homeless Youth. Farah is currently starting an internship at OutFront to extend the work he was doing in the Minneapolis Public Schools teaching educators about trans issues. He just started testosterone but got off it because of difficultly with insurance. He got a PFund Scholarship for $10,000 for college tuition, and he’s allowed to use the money for top surgery. He describes himself as a fuck boy, somebody, he says, “who doesn’t have serious relationships and just goes around.” He will be going to Augsburg College to study pre-med to become one of the first black trans men surgeons.","Bisexual Black Trans Man; Intersex; Assigned Female at Birth; East Africa; Kenya; Somalia; Small Farming Village; Immigration; United States; New York City; Post 9/11; u.s.

Her mother was an elementary school teacher before she had her and her five brothers. She was born in Racine, Wisconsin and then moved to Dunedin, Florida a year later. A year after she then moved to Wauwatosa, Wisconsin where she grew up. Wauwatosa was a white suburban town outside of Milwaukee. As a kid she traveled a decent amount to Milwaukee, Wisconsin some to Chicago, Illinois and a lot of trips to Madison, Wisconsin. She always could acknowledge within herself that she was different from a lot of other kids. It was easier to connect what was different about herself to her sexuality since the world is obsessed with sex and sexuality. She found herself attracted to boys. She lived with her friend Julia and her family until she graduated high school after being kicked out of her home by her parents during her senior year of high school. Her parented kicked her out because she was openly visible as a queer person. She then moved to Chicago in 2001 where she connected with the organization, About Face Youth Theatre Program, which creates youth trans and queer shows. There she began to recognize questions within herself about why she was so passionate about trans rights and issues. It took her 10 years before she began to answer those questions. Pre-transition she lived as a gay cis male as part of the bear culture. She moved into her gender identity through drag. She started performing in drag in a show called Coed Prison Sluts at Annoyance Theatre in Chicago. She noticed she would get really depressed coming out of costume and then realized she felt connected to this hyper femininity that she performed. She now feels connected to being a crusty girl which she explains is a combination of butch and femme that feels really safe for her. For her it means wearing steam punk boots and fishnets with holes, being totally busted, eating what she wants, and doing what she wants. She has learned the concept of letting herself be the fullest possibility of herself, including letting herself be ugly in certain situations. After her close friend, who was a trans woman of color, committed suicide in 2012, Hnilicka became obsessed with death and realized if she died now nobody would know who she was. This sparked her to allow herself to transition. She now has a great relationship with her family after not speaking to them for about 4 years, everyone now allowing each other to really be themselves. She has been on hormones for two years and is now working on laser hair removal.","White Queer Transgender Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Racine, Wisconsin; Dunedin, Florida; Wauwatosa, Wisconsin; Suburbs; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Chicago, Illinois; Madison, Wisconsin; Kicked Out; Queer; About Face Youth Theatre; Gay; Bear Culture; Drag; Coed Prison Sluts; Annoyance Theatre; Depression; Crusty Girl; Butch; Femme; Suicide; Death; Transition; Hormones; Laser Hair Removal",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:121

She grew up on the north side of Chicago, Illinois in the 1990s and has an older brother. She experienced bullying for being different in fourth and fifth grade. Her parents decided to move her to a private school. She always knew being a boy was wrong and uncomfortable for her, but it took her longer to figure out what would be right for her. She didn’t have any idea about trans identity at the time until late adolescence when she began reading about trans identity online. It was hard for her to identify with others online, however, since she mainly encountered white trans women hating their body and genitalia, which wasn’t part of Kling’s own experiences. She experienced dysphoria but not to the point of hating her body. Kling began to describe herself as trans as early as 15 or 16 but it wasn’t until her early 20s that she began transitioning by going to counseling and starting hormones. She also had laser hair removal and gender reassignment surgery. Her attractions lie mostly with women or femme-presenting folks. Since transitioning she also had sexual experiences with men. She is a storyteller and performer. It took some time for her parents to get onboard with her transition, but they now have strong relationships. She went to college at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. She’s experienced street harassment and people using slurs against her. She was also fired from a teaching job in 2010 for being trans. She pursued legal action from the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but they couldn’t produce evidence, so the case was dropped. She’s active in trans advocacy and has been involved with Creating Change. She also works with Camp Aranu’tiq, a camp for trans and gender-variant youth.

He has two older brothers who stayed in New York after Briem moved to Iowa with his parents. His parents were tender and nurturing and also very progressive and social justice oriented. When his body started going through puberty, he felt desperate, like nothing made sense. He felt out of control, depressed, resentful, and angry. Before puberty it was easier to be a tomboy, but after puberty the gender policing intensified. Not knowing what transgender was and not having the language to articulate his identity, he was unhappy and confused. He began to accept things 8-10 years ago when he changed his name, before he was able to acknowledge to himself that he was transgender. It took him many years to have the courage to connect with a therapist and then a physician who could get him on hormones. He came out at 16 as a lesbian, then as a dyke, then for most of his life as gay or queer. None of those identities felt right, however. He dated women since he was 16. He likes facial hair, he runs a lot, he likes to work out so he’s more comfortable with a muscular, athletic build. He’s always dressed in a way that is perceived more masculine, but he doesn’t really claim being a man or male necessarily. He’s been a tattoo artist for 22 years. When he came out to his parents, they ignored it, but both of his brothers were immediately supportive. He started testosterone three years ago at the time of the interview and had top surgery and a hysterectomy. He struggled with insurance covering his trans related care but his physicians helped him work through it. He is now married to a supportive partner and has a son.","Transgender; Male; Assigned Female at Birth; Syracuse, New York; Des Moines, Iowa; Bullying; Queer Group; Hiv; Suicide; Hate Crime; Puberty; Tomboy; Gender Policing; Name Change; Therapy; Hormones; Lesbian; Dyke; Gay; Queer; Dating; Masculinity; Tattoo Artist; Testosterone; Top Surgery; Hysterectomy; Insurance; Trans Related Health Care; Marriage; Children",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:123

He grew up in West Philadelphia, going to public school for a couple of years and then to Catholic school. Girls didn’t want to play with him and would call him a boy. Boys were cool with him though, and he climbed trees, ran through alleyways, and climbed over people’s fences with them. He refused to put on a dress his parented wanted him to wear for his fourth birthday. His parents also stopped him from hanging out with boys by keeping him inside and telling him, “You’re a girl, you’re not supposed to play with boys so we can’t have you outside.” He could only go outside to play with the girls who he begged to hang out with and then he would sneak over to the boys to play with them instead. He got pregnant at 14 after being molested by a cousin. That experience, he says, led him to be promiscuous with other guys. He hid his pregnancy the entire nine months up until going into labor since he was afraid of his physically abusive father and had a religious, absent mother. When his father found out about the pregnancy, he beat him every day. Osiris was then sent to Chicago, Illinois to live with his grandmother who took care of his baby. Osiris soon ran away from home, leaving his child behind, at around 15 or 16. His daughter contacted Osiris years later, and they had a happy reunion. He moved to New York City and lived in a shelter while he looked for a job and a place to stay. While at Barnes and Noble he discovered the possibility of transitioning when he found a picture book of trans men by Loren Cameron. He immediately knew that’s what he wanted for himself. Since 2001, he works for the New York City Department of Sanitation as a supervisor where he’s experienced discrimination for his trans identity. He experienced 9/11 while in New York City firsthand and recounts those events. He’s on testosterone and had top surgery, a hysterectomy, an oophorectomy, and a phalloplasty. He visits South Africa a lot to visit his best friend.

His family isn’t Catholic, but the school was nearby and convenient. His parents come from a poor working-class background, and he described himself as “a weird, frumpy, androgynous kid.” He related more to girls but didn’t look or act like them. Stringer was picked on a lot for his masculine expression and his differences. People pranked and teased him, so he didn’t know how to trust people. He believed he was straight at the time since he wasn’t attracted to women. He struggled with mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety along with self-harm, suicidality, and loneliness. He was sent to counseling by his parents at 14 where he was told he had an alter ego. He’s also struggled with chronic pain and illness. At 16, Stringer figured out that he was bipolar and was put on medications that caused many awful side effects. He became a health care advocate since he felt he had so little power as a kid in the health care system. Stringer went to college at Kent State in Cleveland, Ohio presenting as a femme woman to prevent being teased as he experienced previously. His depression took over, however, and he moved back to Cincinnati where he finished his degree at the University of Cincinnati. He then felt less satisfied with his presentation when he realized he was presenting femme because otherwise he wouldn’t be pretty. He began dressing more masculine, found online sites where trans people talked, and began binding. He got involved in trans activism and became a community organizer primarily in anti-war work and the labor movement. He struggled to find health care that wouldn’t pathologize him nor treat him badly for being trans. He also struggled to find someone who would prescribe testosterone.

They grew up expressing their gender non-conformity during the late 1970s, early 1980s and don’t recall being shamed or policed for their expression too much because they had three protective brothers and a supportive family who had their back.

They see liberation as a form of affirmation and celebration of ourselves and others where we support and uplift each other.

54,Sanchez_Naiymah,"Sanchez, Naiymah","Jenkins, Andrea",1/21/2017,"Naiymah Sanchez identifies as a heterosexual Afro-Latina transgender female of color who was assigned male at birth. She is of Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Ethiopian immigrant decent. She was born in 1983 in the U.S., grew up in the Bronx in New York and moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as a teenager. Expecting a daughter, her parents were both shocked and excited that she was male. As a child she was exposed to the idea of gender transition when she was shown pictures of her gay uncle’s friends who performed in drag and who transitioned themselves. She also has seven brothers and six sisters, some of whom her father had with other women. When she began to question why her sister didn’t have the same genitalia as her, her parents took her to counseling who misdiagnosed her with ADHD, bi-polar disorder, and schizophrenia to implement conversion therapy techniques like medication. She describes herself as pretty effeminate as a child, even being read as a girl by strangers. She went to school in female attire once and was sent to the principal’s office. She was told not to dress that way again. At 11, her mother took her to another doctor who diagnosed her with gender dysphoria. Her mother wasn’t entirely supportive of the idea, but her father was understanding. New York lacked clinics that treated gender identity, but when they moved to Philadelphia she went to the Mazzoni Center which helped her and her family through her transition. She was put on testosterone suppression medication and hid the fact that she was assigned male at birth in school, afraid of homophobic and transphobic incidents. She dated a guy in school who was interested in her. She was afraid to disclose her identity to him, but, after finding out, they went to prom together and were intimate. She talks about the discrimination she has experienced as a transgender person of color, such as employment discrimination, tokenization in the queer community, and doctors stigmatizing her by presuming she’s positive for HIV. She’s uncomfortable with having a penis which makes her depressed, but she struggles to get insurance to cover the procedure. She is part of organizing the Philly Trans March for the last three years, and she was also the co-chair of the Creating Change Conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.","Transgender Female of Color; Heterosexual; Afro Latina; Assigned Male at Birth; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Ethiopian; Immigrant; Bronx, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Counseling; Conversion Therapy; Medication; Adhd; Bi Polar Disorder; Schizophrenia; Effeminate; Gender Dysphoria Diagnosis; Mazzoni Center; Testosterone Suppression Medication; Dating; Discrimination; Tokenization; Hiv Stigma; Bottom Surgery; Depression; Philly Trans March; Creating Change Conference",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:146
99,Seidler_Faye,"Seidler, Faye","Jenkins, Andrea",10/15/2016,"Faye Seidler identifies as a gray ace transgender woman and was assigned male at birth. She mostly grew up in Fargo, North Dakota and in many other towns within North Dakota. She was bullied in school for being the new kid. As a result, she spent a lot of time hiding her differences from others, isolating herself and doing what she could to not draw attention to herself. She wasn’t developing friendships nor going out and discovering who she was. She became depressed. She had workaholic, distant parents who worked in factories and in construction work and left Seidler to herself. She has memories of being in her room, playing by herself, and escaping into literature and video games that she played in the 1990s. She has a sibling who babysat her, but she is 5 years older than Seidler and so they lived in different social worlds. At 11 or 12 she started exploring crossdressing to relive the gender dissonance she was experiencing. Going through puberty was confusing and alarming for her, leading her to feel depressed. Her parents divorced, and she ended up dropping out of high school because of her depression. Her parents wanted her to move out at 17 so she left and got her GED. She spoke to her parents for a few years after, but their relationship was superficial and Seidler didn’t know how to communicate with them. She’s no longer in contact with them but has her chosen family now. She also says she attempted suicide at one point and so she now is a trans mentor to others so that they don’t have to go through the experience of feeling alone and hopeless as she did. At 19, a partner of hers told her about trans identity which made sense to her. She began identifying as genderqueer and then eventually around 23 she met a trans mentor who she talked to about gender. It was difficult for her to transition, however, since she didn’t have the support. After talking to her trans friend again, she gave Seidler a number for a trans therapist. She made an appointment and began hormones soon after. Because she is from a working-class background and must raise her own funds before being reimbursed through insurance, she hasn’t had any trans related surgeries yet. She also had laser hair removal. She now has a lot of passing privilege, she explains. She’s a writer and an activist. She’s in a polyamorous relationship with two fiancés who are trans-identified. She also attended The Great Plains Affirming Campus Conference which dealt with dismantling walls and creating positive change.","Grey Ace Trans Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Fargo, North Dakota; Bullying; Hiding; Isolation; Depression; Escapism; Cross Dressing; Puberty; Divorce; Ged; Chosen Family; Suicide Attempt; Trans Mentor; Trans Identity; Genderqueer; Therapy; Hormones; Working Class; Insurance; Laser Hair Removal; Trans Related Surgeries; Passing Privilege; Writer; Activist; Polyamory; Fiancés; The Great Plains Affirming Campus Conference",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:147

She was 27 at the time of the interview and is the oldest of seven siblings. She grew up in Chicago, Illinois and lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She is a barista, activist, and social instigator. She began identifying as a gay boy at a young age, coming out in elementary school to her friends, since it was the closet identity that made sense at the time. Her mother was forceful when it came to McDonald conforming to masculine gender expectations. McDonald remembers praying to be normal, and she became suicidal and rebellious as a result. She began identifying as a femme queen, and then she started transitioning at 13 at the Howard Brown Center when she lived in Chicago when she began to identify more with being trans and female. At 18 she moved to Minneapolis where she stayed at Dorothy Day shelter in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. She had a difficult time finding a regular job since transitioning. She’s been jumped multiple times, once even getting jumped by seven people at once. In 2011, McDonald was verbally and physically attacked by a group of neo-Nazis. She stabbed one of her attackers who died. She ended up in jail and was charged with second degree murder. She decided to take it to trial after the first plea deal. After nine months in jail and after seeing where the case was going, she decided to take a plea deal. She spent 19 months in jail and 13 months on parole. A documentary came out in 2016 called Free CeCe! produced by Laverne Cox which speaks to McDonald’s experiences in jail and going to trail. In her interview, she talks about the criminal justice system’s discrimination against black and trans people. She also talks about how HIV/AIDS is a stigmatized identity. She’s been in an open relationship with a straight man for 5 years now. She goes to Smiley’s Clinic to get her hormones and recently got her first laser hair removal treatment done.

She was always tiny, she says, but in her mind, she was always big. She grew up feeling loved by her single mother in a lower middle-class predominately black neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio where she felt connected to other black people. She is the middle child of 3. She grew up in an Apostolic church from around age 8 to 13 singing choir, speaking in tongues, and going to bible study and youth night. Her father lived in the next neighborhood over with another household. She felt different, always very feminine and feeling like a little girl, and she didn’t know how to embrace that at the time. Hearns felt a certain pressure to be the man of the house by providing emotional support since her household was all women. She felt extremely loved but also extremely bullied by her family, experiencing different levels of violence that she would never excuse now that she’s older. She was bullied in school for being perceived as gay. She came out early, forced out by her family when she was 12. As a result, she became suicidal but at 16 she began to wear women’s clothes that her friends gave to her. Avoiding going to the barber shop where they masculinized her, which she did not like, she grew her hair out into a big afro and dyed it. Without any knowledge of trans identity, she couldn’t articulate who she was. She went to Central State University, an all-Black college in Wilberforce, Ohio, but she left school early since she could not afford it and since she was beginning to realize she was trans. At 25 she began to really bloom. She lived in New York as a trans woman without articulating her identity as a trans woman. After two trans women were murdered, Hearns began seeking more information online about what it meant to be trans. Not feeling comfortable in LGBTQ spaces since others would look at her like she didn’t belong since she was a hood girl, she always created her own community. When she began to name what she was to others, requiring them to honor her pronouns, she started to lose relationships. She also had a hard time finding jobs, became homeless, found herself in a verbally abusive relationship that led to sexual assault, and ended up in jail because an officer could not identify her gender. She finds joy in organizing, wanting to help and support other people find freedom. She organized other trans women by starting the Trans Women of Color Collective of Ohio. Their first action was at the Columbus Health Department where they had a trans health care summit. They went up to the microphone to talk about their lack of support for black trans women and shut the place down. The following year the Columbus Health Department opened a clinic. Hearns later became the first paid staff for the Black Lives Matter Network.","Black Trans Woman; Black Neighborhood; Columbus, Ohio; Church; Bullying; Gender Expectations; Gay; Outed; Coming Out; Suicide; Central State University; Wilberforce, Ohio; New York; Murder; Lgbtq Spaces; Homeless; Verbal Abuse; Sexual Assault; Jail; Organizing; Trans Women of Color Collective of Ohio; Columbus Health Department; Trans Health Care Summit; Activism; Black Lives Matter",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:150

He was born in Maple Grove, Minnesota where his parents grew up and then moved to Monticello, Minnesota in second grade. Schwartz has two younger brothers. In high school he was out as gay and presented masculine. He never identified as a lesbian since the term made him uncomfortable, and now he understands why since coming out as trans. He didn’t know anyone else who was queer in high school and was lonely. He grew up going to Pride in a queer and trans-friendly household where one of his grandparents is trans. His parents were accepting of Schwartz when he came out to them as queer. Around 19 or 20 while in college he started questioning his gender and later came out as trans on Facebook to most people in his life. He’s not out to his immediate family yet. He generally dates femme presenting people or cis women. Since coming out and finding community, he’s felt more comfortable, more relaxed, and less on edge. He’s in therapy at the Program in Human Sexuality. Schwartz plans on having top surgery and, most of the time, would like to see himself starting hormones.

Her mom worked for the hospital as a cancer nurse, and her dad worked to mechanize and bring up to code medical gas. She was teased for having thick glasses and contact lenses that would fall out. In sixth or seven grade Stein realized she was trans after a Google search but decided to repress that part of herself since she experienced others demeaning gender non-conformity. Her dad even told her in a joking manner, “If you ever feel that way, let me know so I can move out.” She became a class clown as the funny dude to have friends, even hosting a talent show in high school. She was also in orchestra and played the cello. Stein went to Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin as a theatre major and tried coming out as bi midway through her degree. She remembers crying after going to the school therapist who told her she was possibly trans when she was feeling suicidal. She’s relied on friends and community who helped her normalize trans identity. She’s been on hormones since she finished college and had laser hair removal on her face and legs. She is also considering gender reassignment surgery but doesn’t want to wind up in debt. She’s dealt with sexual harassment since transitioning, experiencing lewd comments from men. Stein also experienced physical assault when a man attempted to rob her by slapping and hitting her. She was worried about coming out to her father, but both her parents are supportive. Her parents even helped her pick her new name. She worked for Environment Minnesota that required her to canvas door-to-door during the winter and soon quit. Stein came out while working for a Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota and presented full-time as a woman there. She then left to work at a women’s clothing consignment store.

Her parents relocated to Denver, Colorado when her mom got a job as a civilian nurse in the Army at Fitts and Zimmer Medical Center. In 1995, Vanderheiden moved to Rochester, Minnesota when her mom got a job at the Federal Medical Center, a prison medical center with the Bureau of Prisons. Vanderheiden spent a lot of her childhood on military bases for daycare. She grew up in a very conservative religious evangelical family. Her religion led to a lot of shame towards her gender identity, and so she repressed it for a long time until she sloughed off her religion. She describes herself as never being like the boys and didn’t have too many friends in middle school. In high school, she grew her friend circle with the artsy and theater kids. She experienced bullying and fighting, defending herself by preemptively becoming aggressive with others. Growing up her favorite game was dressing up with the neighbor girls. For a while she thought she was a crossdresser since middle school or earlier, locking herself in the bathroom to do her makeup and get dressed in feminine clothes. She graduated high school and then went to college for a year but ran out of money. She then joined the Air Force for six years and talks about Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell and being trans in the military. After leaving the Air Force she went back to school for global studies. After taking a revolutionary thinkers class that helped her process her religion when she was 28, she began to accept herself as a woman in late 2013 or early 2014. She hopes to join the reserves for the National Guard, but her hormone replacement therapy precludes her from service right now. She receives medical treatment through the VA, Veteran’s Affairs, but they do not provide surgical interventions for transgender individuals. Vanderheiden has gone through laser hair removal and speech therapy to help her develop a more feminine voice. She is considering bottom and top surgery, a trach shave, and facial feminization surgery. She recently got a job with the federal government at the social security office. She experienced sexual assault when a man began to help himself to her body after finding out she was trans. Vanderheiden struggles tensing up around law enforcement afraid of transphobia. Her parents struggled with her transition, and they still misgender her but they use her name. She is connected to the Minnesota Transgender Health Coalition, the Queer Veterans Support Group held by Lutheran Family Services, Rare Productions, and she worked some with Outfront involved in lobbying efforts. She was married and had two kids with a woman before she medically transitioned. Her wife struggled with her transition and was unable to continue the marriage, but she is one of Vanderheiden’s greatest supporters and encourages Vanderheiden to explore and express herself. While transitioning Vanderheiden began to isolate herself, not leaving the house, since she experienced looks of disgust and feeling of unsafety until she began to pass.

They were a tomboy growing up liking sports and being very aggressive and competitive. People often assumed he was a lesbian from a young age. He struggled with a “messed up family life” with an abusive stepfather and other abusive men in his life. As a result, they ended up in violent, reactive relationships with a lot of anger. Pérez isn’t a particularly aggressive person now. Their mom forced them to wear clothing from the girl’s section at around 15 while clothes shopping, telling them they needed to grow up and stop “walking like a tranny.” In college he discovered gender theory and feminism, even producing a production of the Vagina Monologues. When Pérez went to Puerto Rico at 20, they met some family for the first time and was told by a janitor to use the men’s bathroom since they were read as a man at the time. It didn’t occur to Pérez, however, that he would be trans. During college at Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vermont, they began identifying as genderqueer since the idea of manhood associated with toxic masculinity scared them. He began dating someone for the first time in college at the age of 19 who knew Pérez was trans before he did and encouraged him to bind and try using a masculine name. After some contemplation and hesitation, Pérez began hormone therapy and had top surgery. He also began to see that there are different kinds of men who aren’t violent and aggressive. He now mainly has sex with gay men. They work from home for a transgender resource and support line organization called The Trans Lifeline. He also started the Trans Oral History Project about eight years ago but is now starting to focus more on documentary work.

Mohamed prefers being referred to by name over the use of pronouns. Mohamed grew up in Tanzania, East Africa until 19 and is of South Asian descent. Mohamed grew up in a South Asian religious community called Ismaili Muslims, which is part of the Shia sect and is led by the Aga Khan. A major stressor in school for Mohamed was the intense academic pressure to perform academically, being publicly ranked in comparison to other students. As a child, Mohamed identified as a boy. Mohamed’s mom was accepting of it but Mohamed still, resentfully, wore a dress to the mosque. Mohamed could sit on the male side as well in the mosque. A couple of aunts, unsure of and confused by Mohamed’s sex while hiking on a path, pulled off Mohamed’s clothes to check. Mohamed felt bizarre and violated by what happened, and it’s a painful memory. After beginning to menstruate, Mohamed was devastated and didn’t want to be a woman. Mohamed defied womanhood by continuing to wear shorts and male clothing except at school where girls were required to wear a skirt. Experiencing domestic violence in the home, Mohamed was kicked out and went to live with another family where conforming as a girl was enforced. Mohamed came out as a lesbian after coming to the U.S. to live in Minnesota on a student visa but began to feel uncomfortable, body and presentation wise. Geographically and gender wise, Mohamed lives in “this in-between world of negotiating… space” in community and culture, seeing things “in complexity, in multiple frames” due to Mohamed’s African, South Asian, Muslim, and immigrant sides and Mohamed’s complex relationship with gender. Mohamed hasn’t faced judgment or alienation due to gender from extended family who are supportive. Mohamed’s dad cut off paying tuition to prevent Mohamed from going to school, however. As a result, Mohamed violated the student visa and was undocumented for 4 years. Mohamed is currently single but co-parents two adopted black kids who are siblings of each other.

He grew up in Montrose, Minnesota on a dairy farm in the middle of a cornfield and went to school in Buffalo, Minnesota. He has 8 younger brothers and an older sister. His birth mother had him when she was 15, and as a child he lived with her in an apartment above a dentist shop. His birth mother later left him with her current husband at the time who he still considers to be his dad. He hasn’t seen his birth mother since. He was picked on in school for being a farm kid and was also held back in kindergarten since his teachers believed he needed to understand the fundamental differences between boys and girls. He demanded one of his teachers to call him Christopher and didn’t understand why he couldn’t run around without a shirt on like the boys. Seeing himself as a farm boy, he would sneakily stuff a rolled-up sock in his pants when he would go milk the cows. He also wore boy’s clothes, wanted to shop in the boy’s section at stores, and wanted to cut his hair off. He was outed as a lesbian by a friend of his when he was 15. Even though the label felt like a gross misrepresentation to Lyrek, he attempted to embrace it since he thought maybe it was a word you just had to get used to using. It was also the closest word that he had to describe himself at the time. He fully embraced being a ‘90s riot grrrl dyke and shaved his head. His dad was physically and mentally abusive, leaving Lyrek feeling angry all the time. He was suspended around 5 times in school for getting into a lot of fist fights. Onetime Lyrek had fifth degree assault charges pressed against him that were later dropped for breaking a guy’s nose on his bus after the guy outed another student he called a faggot. He moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota after graduating high school in 1999 and attended St. Catherine University, at the time an all-girls Catholic school. He met another trans person for the first time when he ran into a female to male Minneapolis police officer. Even though he heard about trans women all the time, often in derogatory terms, it never occurred to Lyrek that transitioning to male existed until then. Lyrek asked him a bunch of questions and then spent the next year and a half researching the internet about it. Lyrek’s partner at the time asked him if he wanted to be a guy, and, in the back of his head he was telling himself to say no but then said, “Yeah, I do.” He was also a male drag performer at the time, and his partner may have noticed how he was taking on more of the character’s traits in his daily life that he performed on stage. He decided he needed to tell his parents and siblings before taking steps to physically transition. Most of his siblings were supportive but one of his brothers didn’t speak to him for 5 years since he was religious and believes Lyrek is going to hell as a sinner. His dad responded well and refers to him as his son. His mom tried talking him out of it every step of the way. He started testosterone in 2005, had top surgery in 2007, a hysterectomy in 2013, and a phalloplasty in 2015. He got a blood clot in his groin where the vein was grafted to his femoral artery during his phalloplasty, cutting off the blood supply to his penis and killing about a third of his urethra. He ended up losing an inch and a half of length during surgery to correct it. He had his tenth surgery to correct his urethra so he could stand to pee. He has a 10-year-old daughter from a 15-year marriage. He’s now divorced and in another relationship with a cis woman. He doesn’t identify with straight culture, but he likes women and identifies as male.","Straight Male; Assigned Female at Birth; Montrose, Minnesota; Dairy Farm; Buffalo, Minnesota; Bullying; Farm Boy; Sock Stuffing; Boy’s Clothes; Outed; Lesbian; Riot Grrrl; Dyke; Abuse; Suspension; Fist Fights; Assault; Slur; Homophobia; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Catherine University; Internet; Drag; Coming Out; Transition; Testosterone; Top Surgery; Hysterectomy; Phalloplasty; Blood Clot; Urethra; Surgical Complications; Stand to Pee; Daughter; Marriage; Divorce; Straight Culture",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:161
106,Miller_Neno,"Miller, Neno","Jenkins, Andrea",11/29/2016,"Neno Miller identifies as genderqueer, non-binary, trans masculine, and also with the term gender fuck. They were assigned female at birth. Miller grew up in Medford, Wisconsin, which is an isolated, rural town, and they now live in Goodrich/Athens, Wisconsin. They don’t have any siblings, and their parents are still married. Their dad is a construction worker, and their mom worked in a window factory when they were growing up. They were bullied a lot in school for being a bigger kid and for wearing boy’s clothes like boxers. Miller enjoyed school, however, and loved reading as a kid. When they were younger, they presented more masculine, and their family described them as a tomboy. Their parents silenced their masculine expression, not allowing them to get boxers. The last couple of years of high school they began to perform femininity. They first came out as bisexual, then used the label gay. They were in a lesbian-like relationship with the first person they dated. They felt the need to be more feminine with them and would not bind their chest when they were with them. When they came out with their name Neno, they almost lost a couple of close friends. They didn’t come out to their family right away. When they did, it was difficult. Their mom apologized for ever having them, saying she wouldn’t have if she knew about their condition. Miller still talks to their parents, but they don’t call them Neno and they don’t support them getting top surgery. They’ve struggled with bathroom incidents in both the women and men’s bathrooms. They are currently in college at the University of Minnesota in the journalism department.","Genderqueer; Non Binary; Trans Masculine; Gender Fuck; Assigned Female at Birth; Medford, Wisconsin; Athens, Wisconsin; Goodrich, Wisconsin; Bullying; Boy’s Clothes; Reading; Tomboy; Femininity; Bisexual; Gay; Lesbian Relationship; Chest Binding; Coming Out; Top Surgery; Bathrooms; University of Minnesota; Journalism",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:162

He has one older sister. They fought a lot as kids but got closer in high school. After he came out and then later trans, his relationship with his sister deteriorated. She now uses his name and pronouns, however. O’Brien explains that in terms of gender other kids were pretty much the same until hitting puberty. O’Brien began to feel like he didn’t fit in during puberty because he didn’t feel like the girls nor did he feel like the boys. He was also picked on by kids because he was quiet. As a kid, he would steal his dad’s underwear and flannel and wear it to school. He felt tough wearing his dad’s underwear. He also went through a phase trying to pee standing up from around 9 to 11. He played soccer, has a black belt in karate, and he did track and cross country in high school. He also likes to kayak, hike, and paddle board. He was close to his dad growing up, going to the hardware store together, and they understood each other. Once O’Brien hit puberty, however, they were confused on how to handle things. Because O’Brien was raised to be a girl, his father didn’t teach O’Brien how to fix things the way his father taught him. After high school, having more time to think, he paid more attention to his sexuality and came out as a lesbian, but, if he had known differently, would have come out as queer. He dated women who were more feminine or femme. He liked to be the one opening doors and picking up and planning his dates, taking on a more traditional masculine role. He’s also dated trans and cis men and found that, while he couldn’t be with men as a woman, he could be as a man. After read about soft packing in the butch femme community, he bought a packer and wore it. But once he dated a woman who told him, “If I wanted to date a man, I would date a man so why do I want to date a butch woman?” he cut up and threw out his packer which he now regrets. His parents are accepting of his trans identity. He uses a STP, a Stand to Pee, while using the men’s restroom. He’s been on testosterone replacement therapy since 2007. He had top surgery and a total hysterectomy. He’s curious about bottom surgery, but since it’s a rapidly evolving field he’s waiting for the science to advance. Shortly after exploring the gay male world, he met his wife. He works for the University of Minnesota’s Program in Human Sexuality as the communications officer. He volunteered for Minnesota Trans Health Coalition helping people administer their shots. He also volunteered for TYSN, the Trans Youth Support Network, Twin Cities Avengers, and District 202.","Male; Assigned Female at Birth; Holliston, Massachusetts; Puberty; Peeing Standing Up; Soccer; Karate; Track; Cross Country; Kayak; Hike; Paddle Board; Coming Out; Lesbian; Queer; Dating; Soft Packing; Stp; Stand to Pee; Restrooms; Testosterone; Top Surgery; Hysterectomy; Bottom Surgery; University of Minnesota’s Program in Human Sexuality; Communications Officer; Volunteer; Minnesota Trans Health Coalition; Tysn; Trans Youth Support Network; Twin Cities Avengers; District 202",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:163

She is a mixture of Laotian, Thai, Vietnamese, and some French and Chinese. She is a refugee immigrant from the Post-Vietnam War era in Thailand. She came to the United States as a child with her parents and lived with relatives in Hartford, Connecticut for about a year before moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota for better jobs and resources. In Minneapolis she lived in the projects in north Minneapolis where she played with many Hmong, Laotian, Asians, and African Americans kids outside. She then moved to a Minneapolis public housing home in south Minneapolis which improved her family’s life a little. She is the eldest of a sister and two brothers. Sirisavith gravitated more towards girly, feminine things such as dolls, dresses, and long beautiful hair as a child. She grew up with self-hatred towards her trans identity, however, leading her to suppress it for a long time. She was also traumatized in school by boys who bullied and harassed her for her feminine traits and behavior. This experience led her to hide her feelings and identity more and to act more masculine like a man. She avoided dating growing up and had few friends since she describes herself as timid, shy, and an outcast. As her body masculinized while going through puberty, she felt hideous and became depressed, leading her to isolate herself more. Sirisavith attended Mankato State University for their aviation program to become a pilot, but she switched her major to nutrition with an emphasize in food service management, hoping to one day open her own restaurant. After college, she began to come out slowly as gay, beginning with a couple of close friends. She also began to seek out friends in the LGBTQ community by joining GLASS, Gay Lesbian Amateur Sports Society. After being inspired by Boystown, a gay neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois she opened her own business in Uptown Minneapolis with a lesbian friend of hers called the GLBT Spot. After the GLBT Spot closed after deciding not to renew the lease, she opened a boutique in Rosemount which was more focused on products for women. She’s also a fashion designer and realtor part time, catering to the LGBTQ community. She began to fully accept herself as a trans woman instead of as a gay man after doing drag a couple of times, meeting and talking to trans people, going to support groups. She’s since started hormones and, liking the results, feels happier and more confident. When she can afford it, she would like to have top and bottom surgery. She’s part of the Transgender Health Coalition. In her interview, she also talks about katoey, language for LGBTQ people, and medical tourism in Thailand.","Trans Female; Assigned Male at Birth; Laotian; Thai; Vietnamese; French; Chinese; Refugee Immigrant; Post Vietnam War Era; Thailand; United States; Hartford, Connecticut; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Public Housing; Feminine Expression; Suppression; Self Hatred; Trauma; Bullying; Harassment; Hiding; Shy; Outcast; Isolation; Mankato State University; Aviation; Pilot; Nutrition; Coming Out; Gay; Boystown; Chicago, Illinois; Gay Neighborhood; Lgbtq Community; Glass; Gay Lesbian Amateur Sports Society; Glbt Spot; Boutique; Realtor; Self Acceptance; Drag; Hormones; Top Surgery; Bottom Surgery; Transgender Health Coalition; Katoey; Medical Tourism",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:165

She grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota, and she has sisters. She realized from the young age of 4 or 5 that she wanted to be around girls and to wear dresses and tight jeans. In high school she experimented with cross-dressing, trying on her mom’s dress skirt, blouses, bras, and heels. She played sports and had a basketball hoop and a bike. She then moved to Roseville, Minnesota in 1987. Her dad was a detective in law enforcement, and her parents divorced after she graduated college. She knew there wasn’t something right about herself, a constant feeling of being uncomfortable and feeling alone and isolated. She was a class clown, but it felt like it was a performance. She excelled in school and played soccer, hiding behind those activities. In college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, Wisconsin in 1998, she discovered the term transsexual online and realized that was her. She has a master’s in Technical Communication. She’s experienced catcalling, getting called a faggot and some other mutterings and looks from people. She got engaged and came out in 2006 to her fiancée and her parents who were accepting.

She excelled in sports such as baseball and football and always yearned to be the cheerleaders. One time she got into her mother’s makeup and put on one of her slips. Her parents shamed her when they found out. She repressed her femininity, at least outwardly. She left school and didn’t graduate and began working for a clinic. She began taking unprescribed birth control pills to access female hormones at her job. The clinic found out she was taking the pills and fired her. She then opened up to her wife of five years at the time about her gender. Her wife told her she didn’t marry a lesbian and that it wasn’t going to work out. Vezina ended up in Tucson, Arizona separated from her wife and got a job at a company there as a woman in the middle of transitioning. It was relatively easy for her to pass as well. Her job then sent her to San Diego, California to run the office there in 1978. She got into a gender program at the University of California San Diego that required people to live the gender of their choice for 2 years before providing hormones or surgery. Vezina went to college at the University of Vermont and then got married. She went to graduate school in Manchester, New Hampshire where she got her master’s in history.

She was born and raised in Farmington, New Mexico and grew up in a conservative Christian home. She has an older brother and a sister but was practically raised as an only child since her siblings left home when she was still young. Her father retired as a firefighter and her mom retired as a transcriptionist. From a young age, Veazey knew she wasn’t a boy. She also knew, however, that it wasn’t okay for her to be a girl and, growing up in a religious household, part of her thought she was going to hell. She buried and fought the feelings, the stress, and the dysphoria by throwing herself into her schoolwork by reading, studying, listening, and paying attention. She was bullied in school since people thought she was weird and overweight, so she kept quiet and became a loner with a few friends. She knew she was a woman by puberty and figured out how to recognize herself as a trans woman. She then talked to people online about trans issues. Veazey came out to her mom, and she took it better that she expected, coming to acceptance within six weeks. Her father, however, disowned her but allows her mom to still have a relationship with her. She’s not particularly close to her siblings but her sister is supportive. She’s unsure of her brother, however, since he hasn’t spoken to her since coming out to him. After coming out she remembers her stress levels decreasing and she could think clearer and make better decisions since she was no longer carrying the weight of her identity. Veazey is currently with a trans woman who she met online. She scheduled her gender confirmation surgery, had laser hair removal, and is on hormones since 2014. Before transitioning, she felt safe in public space since people would give her more space and respect but now that she presents as a woman it’s nerve-wracking. It led her to make transgender health care her passion and specialty. She went to medical school and now works at a hospital as a resident physician. In 2016, she initiated an adult gender and sexual health clinic at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.","Transgender Woman; Bisexual; Assigned Male at Birth; Farmington, New Mexico; Conservative; Christian; Bullying; Overweight; Quiet; Loner; Dysphoria; Coming Out; Stress; Gender Confirmation Surgery; Laser Hair Removal; Hormones; Transitioning; Transgender Health Care; Medical School; Resident Physician; Gender and Sexual Health Clinic; Hennepin County Medical Center; Minneapolis, Minnesota",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:170

She had a strained relationship with her older brother who would tease her as a kid, but she’s now closer to her brother and is very close to her sister as well. People around her, including her family, sensed Willis was different in some way as a kid but couldn’t put their finger on it, including Willis herself. Her father thought her mother was too soft and forgiving with Willis as a child. He was constantly attempting to involve Willis in sports and to butch Willis up telling her to “Dry them eyes, boy.” She came out to her mom as gay at 14 leading to her mom placing her in religious counseling. The counselor was pretty affirming for Willis, however. She came out to her dad a year later at 15 as gay. He wasn’t pleased. He told her it was just a phase, that she would get over it, and fought Willis to not come out at school. Later, her father died before she came out as trans. She thought she was gay because at the time she did not know anything about trans identity. She dated a trans man in college at 21 who was affirming of her identity and helped her realize she was, in fact, a trans woman. She started hormones and performed in drag as Roxy which helped her realize it was the only place to express herself as a woman and let go.

For example, while biking home as a kid someone in a truck slowed down and called her a “nigga.” Raised to be a black boy, it was difficult to explore gender even though gender was something always in the back of her head. The mother of one of her brother’s friends encouraged them to cross-dress, and Nawa never felt so at peace while cross-dressing. Nawa came out as bisexual and then as gay. Once she started expressing herself as a gay man, she was able to wear nail polish and embody more effeminate mannerisms. She was kicked out of her parent’s house and moved in with her grandmother where she was more accepted and was able to explore herself more. She then lived with her great grandmother and then stayed in a house where there was a lot of drugs and impromptu parties. She then lost her job and couldn’t pay rent, so she moved back in with her mother who required her to follow many rules. She then got into a car accident with her parent’s car, resulting in her getting kicked out again. Her dad told her they also kicked her out because they knew she was trans. She has a better relationship with her parents now, but they struggled accepting her for some time. Her brothers still don’t accept her. Nawa went to Regency Beauty School but didn’t finish since she didn’t feel comfortable having the power to tell others if they looked good or not. Nawa was once picked up by the police while she was wearing a wig and other feminine apparel. They held her overnight. When Nawa was 20 she attempted suicide and self-medicated with alcohol.

She remembers watching trans women through their transitioning YouTube videos. She doesn’t always identify as a woman though. She has a partner who is non-binary. She was on hormone replacement therapy once, but it was too expensive since her insurance didn’t cover it.

They have three older sisters, and they were raised by their grandmother who died when they were 14. They also have a couple of younger half-brothers, but they didn’t grow up with them. Their dad wasn’t around, perhaps struggling with addiction, and their mother was in the city but didn’t take care of them. They went to a few different high schools, one being a progressive high school in western Massachusetts where they realized they weren’t straight. They began thinking more about their gender beyond the binary in their early 20s and found that they were attracted to folks who weren’t cis men. They’ve come out, and their family is supportive of their identity. Lee also talks about how gender non-conforming people are constantly rendered invisible. They believe getting top surgery would help them feel more whole, but they also want kids and want to do more research before pursuing it. They are in a committed, loving relationship for over a year. They volunteered at the Sexual Violence Center and Lobby Day at OutFront. They did some letter writing for Black and Pink, which is an organization that connects those who are incarcerated with those on the outside. They also served as the Chair of the Trans Commission, which is now the Trans Advisory and Action Team for two or three years. They are currently the Assistant Director of the Gender and Sexuality Center for Queer and Trans Life.","Gender Non Conforming; Non Binary; Assigned Female at Birth; Cambodian; Chinese; Vietnamese; Long Beach, California; Gang Violence; Mexican; Gunshots; Massachusetts; Gender Non Conforming Invisibility; Coming Out; Top Surgery; Relationship; Massachusetts; Out Front; Lobby Day; Black and Pink; Trans Commission; Trans Advisory and Action Team; Assistant Director of the Gender and Sexuality Center for Queer and Trans Life",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:175

She is a black trans female living with AIDS and was assigned male at birth. She was born in Madison, Wisconsin, predominately raised in Chicago, Illinois with her father and her father’s parents, and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with her grandmother. She also lived in Kansas City, Missouri and Seattle, Washington. When she was 2, she knew she was gay, realizing she liked men when she would stare at them when they came over to her home, but not the women. Her father, a brick mason and construction worker, didn’t care when Amore came out to him, loving her anyways. Her mother, however, didn’t like it. Her father was killed in 1970 when Amore was 12. Her mother had 5 boys at the time and, when she remarried Amore’s stepfather a few years afterwards, the two adopted 4 girls and 2 boys. She didn’t tell people that she was gay, but people could tell since she was so feminine. As a kid people would bully her. She once beat up a cousin of hers who took her lunch money every day. She had two best friends as a kid who she grew up with into adulthood who were also both gay. She realized she was trans when her best friend, Deja, who is also trans, made her up, dressing her as a woman. Amore felt more comfortable and felt she looked good. Shortly after, she was hired as one of the La Femme girls as a performer the Gay 90s. She contracted HIV in 1990, and she’s been living with AIDS since 1993. She then struggled with additions to street drugs like cocaine, acid, and pills, but she’s been clean and sober since 2003. She works at a NutraSweet plant doing computer work. She used to work for the Minnesota Twins in the two World Series and other jobs she could find. She still goes to church, and she prays daily in the morning which helps her feel grateful for her life. She is currently on hormones and considering surgery. She dates and has sex with men. She will go out with a woman and have fun but doesn’t date them. She broke off getting married to her partner of 15 years when he began drinking. She worries a lot about going places by herself as a trans woman of color, afraid of harassment. She sometimes went to the Exchange, which is part of Café SouthSide, where she met other trans people through their trans support group.","Black Trans Female; Assigned Male at Birth; Aids; Madison, Wisconsin; Chicago, Illinois; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Seattle, Washington; Gay; Coming Out; Feminine; Bullying; Trans; La Femme Girls; Gay 90s; Hiv; Addiction; Sober; Nutra Sweet; Minnesota Twins; World Series; Church; Prayer; Hormones; Surgery; Dating; Harassment; Trans Woman of Color; The Exchange; Café South Side; Trans Support Group",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:176
75,Winter_Elliot,"Winter, Elliot","Jenkins, Andrea",6/8/2016,"Elliot Winter identifies as a transgender male and was assigned female at birth. One of his earliest memories is fighting his parents to wear clothing that suited him as a child. He moved around a lot, living in Ohio and New Jersey, but mainly grew up in Georgia. He was born in Seoul, Korea and was adopted soon after in Ohio where he got immediate citizenship. He has a Korean brother who is also adopted, and they both experienced bullying for their race. Winter grew up with white religious upper middle-class parents in nice neighborhoods. His mother was a stay-at-home mom since his dad was a financially stable corporate guy working in marketing. Winter was a tomboy despite his mom’s attempts to instill femininity in him by going to Girl Scouts and gymnastics and wearing dresses. He recalls feeling very different from others in school. He was bullied late in elementary school and all the way through middle school. He played soccer and participated in student government in high school. He started using drugs such as opiates to cope and conform to gender expectations beginning at the young age of 10. He began to sober up and get back to his body by choosing clothing that suited him and acting more himself. Around 18 after participating in online internet community where people talked about their experiences with trans identity, things clicked for him and he began to learn everything he could about transition. He began transitioning in California getting top surgery and going on hormones for the past 4-5 years. He is pursuing bottom surgery as well. He is currently in a committed relationship with a woman, and he’s becoming more comfortable with saying he’s bisexual. Winter’s parents struggled with his transition, but both his parents are now accepting of him.","Trans Man; Assigned Female at Birth; Georgia; Ohio; New Jersey; Seoul, Korea; Adoption; Bullying; Religion; Tomboy; Gender Conformity; Soccer; Opiates Drug Addiction; Sober; Online Internet Community; California; Transition Related Surgery; Top Surgery; Hormones; Bottom Surgery; Bisexual",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:177

They use they/them pronouns, but predominately also use he/him pronouns depending on the space they are in. He was born in Atkinson, Nebraska, and then after his parents split he moved to Page, Nebraska, a rural farming, conservative Nebraska town. As an only child, he helped his stepdad working on the farm. Growing up they knew they were attracted to traditionally feminine bodies and that there was something different about them they couldn’t name. When they were young up until junior high, they presented more masculine like a tomboy with short hair wearing boy’s clothes. He was teased and bullied predominately by boys in school. During junior high he began to dress in feminine clothing, grew out his hair, and wore makeup since he thought that was a good way to attract other girls. During his first year in college he came out as bi and dated a cis man. Poessnecker broke up with him though when he started to realize he wasn’t physically or emotionally attracted to him. Poessnecker then came out to his small circle of friends and then later his family as a lesbian and joined the Pride Club. Lesbian didn’t feel right, however, so they began identifying as gay. They completed their master’s in Mankato, Minnesota where they came out as queer. During his master’s after taking their first feminist theory course, Poessnecker began to think a lot about gender identity. He also met his current partner of 4 years during grad school. She previously had a trans partner, and Poessnecker would ask her questions about their trans experience and that’s when he decided he wanted the same for himself. He identified as gender non-binary for a while and then genderqueer. Wanting to remove himself from the status quo of what constitutes masculinity in our culture, he began identifying as a non-binary trans man, but that didn’t feel right so he now identifies as trans masculine. He always appeared to be much younger than his actual age and so struggled to gain credibility in professional settings, and he’s also experienced being minimized and diminished by others because of his young appearance. He’s always had more of a husky build, so he hasn’t experienced many issues using the restroom and passing. Even before starting testosterone in 2016 and top surgery in 2017, he was passing 50% of the time. They are currently a director of an LGBTQ Center.","Queer Trans Masculine Guy; Assigned Female at Birth; Atkinson, Nebraska; Page, Nebraska; Rural; Farming; Conservative; Masculine; Tomboy; Bisexual; Lesbian; Pride Club; Gay; Mankato, Minnesota; Master’s; College; Feminist Theory; Gender Identity; Non Binary; Genderqueer; Trans Man; Restrooms; Passing; Testosterone; Top Surgery; Lgbtq Center |",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:178

She was born and raised in Portland, Oregon as well as Beaverton, Oregon, which is a suburb outside of Portland. She was a ward of the court and was placed with an adopted family until she was 16. She has one biological brother and some significantly older siblings within her adopted family that she doesn’t know too well. At 3 or 4 she took a bath with a cousin who was assigned female at birth and realized something was wrong or something didn’t match up. She began to feel as if she was born in the wrong body. She went to a Jesuit school, public school, and then to Catholic schools. She went to school as a girl in 4th grade, and she was never outed but she was eventually told by her adopted family to stop after neighbors began to express concern that a boy was wearing girl clothes. She then went into the closet. Going through puberty was uncomfortable and so Said gained and lost weight as a result. She wanted to shave her face, but her parents wouldn’t allow her to do so. She was teased, made fun of, and harassed in middle school for being seen as gay. She came out as gay freshmen year of high school. Her junior year she started wearing girls’ and boys’ clothes, abbreviated her dead name, and was pretty fluid. After seeing Isis King on America’s Next Top Model, she learned what transgender meant and realized that’s what she was. She was also boy crazy, baking cupcakes and writing love notes for them when she had crushes on them. She didn’t come out when she decided to transition so her parents ended up finding her using lip gloss and wearing a rhinestone mini-skirt and a tank top. They forced her to move out at 16. She had a job and lived with roommates until she finished high school. A program called Upward Bound paid for her tuition at Portland State. Her parents still don’t really see her because of their religious convictions. She contemplated and attempted suicide, motivating her to transition. She moved to San Francisco, California where she lived in non-profit housing called Ark House. She also met other trans women that she had more in common with than in Portland and worked as a sex worker. She then started working at NGOs and community-based organizations before getting a government job. She talks about Miss Bobbie Jean Baker, a matriarch in the trans community who she met at City of Refuge Church in San Francisco. Miss Baker mothered Said and showed her how to navigate systems and taught her street smarts. Said also talks about Miss Major, who developed the TGI Justice Project and who was involved in the Stonewall riots. Said has pursued hormones along with orchiectomy and laser treatments to remove body hair. She still lives in San Francisco, California.","Black Heterosexual Transsexual Female; Trans Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Portland, Oregon; Beaverton, Oregon; Suburbs; Adopted; Puberty; Born in the Wrong Body; The Closet; Bullying; Coming Out; Gay; Isis King; America’s Next Top Model; Transgender; Upward Bound; Portland State; Suicide; San Francisco, California; Ark House; Sex Work; Community Based Organizations; Miss Bobbie Jean Baker; City of Refuge Church; Miss Major; Tgi Justice Project; Stonewall Riots; Hormones; Orchiectomy; Laser Treatments",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:180

He was born and raised in Sterling, Illinois in a working-class family. For the past 25 years he’s been estranged from his family who were abusive towards him. He grew up isolated in a small rural area and doesn’t remember having many friends. Singer’s grandmother was the only person who gave him permission to be who himself. His mom would force him to wear dresses which he didn’t like since he felt exposed, so he would wear pants underneath. He says he didn’t have a relationship to his experience of gender for a long time since he felt there was something else that he never experienced and yearned for in his life. He was uncomfortable in his body from the time that he hit puberty. He went to college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, Wisconsin, and he was involved in radical lesbian separatist feminism. He took on a butch dyke identity in his 30s during the 1980s. Singer lived for at least 15 years as a highly visible female-bodied masculine person and experienced violence directed at him, people yelling and throwing things out of cars and someone telling him they were going to kill him. When he found out about the term transgender it was phenomenally important to him since it gave him a diagnosis for what he was. Before starting hormones, he describes himself as extremely rigid about his masculinity and feeling unable to speak in public or do other things since he felt he wasn’t in a body that he wanted to present to others. He’s been on hormones for a while now and had top surgery. He helped organized the first public trans event in Philadelphia called Bridges to Coalition: A Community Forum on Trans Issues. It drew in about 200 people from across the east coast and the Midwest, and Leslie Feinberg was the keynote speaker. The event became the catalyst for various political actions, including starting the Transgender Health Action Coalition, or THAC. He has a PhD where he studied transgender health, history, politics, and ethnographies, and he is also an activist.","Trans Man; Assigned Female at Birth; Sterling, Illinois; Working Class; Abuse; Isolation; Rural; Puberty; University of Wisconsin Madison; Madison, Wisconsin; Radical Lesbian Separatist Feminism; Butch Dyke; Street Harassment; Violence; Hormones; Top Surgery; Philadelphia; Bridges to Coalition: A Community Forum on Trans Issues; Leslie Feinberg; Transgender Health Action Coalition; Thac; Activist",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:181
162,Neal_Ameriah,"Neal, Ameriah","Jenkins, Andrea",12/1/2016,"Ameirah Neal is a 27 years old straight transgender woman of color who was assigned male at birth. She grew up on the southeast side of Washington, D.C. She realized from the young age of 5 that she was different since she was attracted to the male sex. She didn’t feel male growing up and didn’t feel right being a boy. Instead she felt submissive and feminine, always hanging out with the girls playing jump rope and Double Dutch, braiding hair, and dancing to music with them. Neal was raised as an only child by her single mother who was mentally absent due to drugs. When she was 18 Neal met another trans woman, Misty, who is now her gay mother, at a ball in Baltimore where she realized it was possible to transition. Within three months, Neal was performing drag and began self-medicating with underground hormones, such as spiro, Premarin, and Estradiol. She’s also had breast augmentation in 2016. At 19 before leaving for college in 2009 at the Art Institute of York, Pennsylvania to study fashion marketing, she came out to her mother who was supportive of her transition but also adamant that Neal make something of herself. Neal stayed away from home for a year while in college, isolating herself and slipping into depression. In college people whispered and ridiculed her for her appearance, but Neal didn’t put up with bullying by confronting those people. She was homeless at the time of the interview in 2016, staying in shelters in Washington D.C. She works for SMYAL – Supporting Monitoring Youth Alliance League as the peer ED coordinator. She also used to work for HIPS, Helping Individual People Survive, an amazing organization for sex workers. After her mother died of breast cancer Neal was devastated, even attempting suicide a few times since her death. She moved to Tampa, Florida for 4 years where she worked on her BA online in fashion design at the International Academy of Design and Technology. In Tampa she experienced the south, encountering confederate flags and a white guy harassing her and calling her a nigger. She also realized there’s little institutional support for trans women of color. After finishing school in 2015, she moved back to Washington D.C. She experienced transphobia in her dating life, dealing with men who are “tranny chasers” who seek sex with trans people as a sexual fetish or fantasy. She talks about how the black community is divided by class, sexual orientation, and other factors even with the Black Lives Matter movement. She also talks about how she’s a triple threat to society, being black, trans, and educated. She discusses how trans rights are discounted in the LGBTQ community and also recounts being profiled by a cop as a sex worker once.","Trans Woman of Color; Straight; Assigned Male at Birth; Washington, d.c.; Submissive; Feminine; Single Mother; Drugs; Transition; Hormones; Spiro; Premarin; Estradiol; Breast Augmentation; Art Institute of York, Pennsylvania; Fashion Marketing; Coming Out; Isolation; Depression; Bullying; Homeless; Smyal; Supporting Monitoring Youth Alliance League; Peer Ed Coordinator; Hips; Helping Individual People Survive,; Sex Work; Attempted Suicide; Tampa, Florida; International Academy of Design and Technology; The South; Confederate Flags; Harassment; Transphobia; “Tranny Chasers”; Sexual Fetish; Black Community; Black Lives Matter; Trans Rights; Lgbtq Community; Police Profiling",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:182

She got into drag when she was 21, and then at 23 realized it was time to transition. She also dated a trans man who realized she was trans before she did.

They felt more like a tomboy in high school, playing soccer and field hockey as the goalie. They went to Duke University for undergrad in Durham, North Carolina which was a bit challenging since many of the students were privileged in comparison. Perine came out at 19 in 1998 as gay. Their mom already knew when they came out to her and had a hard time with it, but she is doing a lot better with it now. Perine hesitated coming out to their mom because their father was a closeted gay man. They went to the University of Texas at Austin for graduate school.

She grew up in Duluth, Minnesota with one older sister. She was bullied in school every now and then but sidestepped a lot of it by becoming a good negotiator and choosing the right friends. She remembers wearing her sister’s petticoat and cross dressing her Barbie and Ken. She began to develop breasts because of a delay in testosterone during puberty, but the hormone soon took over and they went away. She kept quiet for years about her identity, but the feelings of wanting to present femininity in her identity wouldn’t go away. She married in the early 1980s, confident those feelings would disappear. She became depressed, however, threatening her marriage. The couple began going to marriage counseling and then individual counseling. In counseling she was able to break through and admit her trans identity. Her counselor found her a crossdressers support group called CLCC, City of Lakes Crossdressers Community. She became suicidal, realizing she had to tell her wife. Once she came out to her wife as a crossdresser though, she was supportive, and they’re still married 34 years later.

He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota and had a difficult childhood. He’s the oldest with two sisters. His mother, who struggled with mental illness, was disappointed Richardson wasn’t a boy when he was born. As a result, Richardson believed he was a boy until his mom told him he wasn’t. Because Richardson looked like his father who was abusive, his mom had a difficult time with it and threw Richardson out when he was 9. He lived with his grandmother until 17 where he was able to overcome some of the abuse that he endured and found an identity of value and worth instead of an identity of burden. He was able to live as a boy with his grandmother, running around shirtless in the summer in shorts, playing with other neighborhood boys, climbing trees until puberty hit. At 10 he began to menstruate and was told by his grandmother that he was a woman now. He worked hard to be a woman by taking modeling and etiquette classes, encouraged by his grandmother who enjoyed Richardson’s femininity. He grew up in a religious Southern Baptist household and rose to positions of leadership quickly within the church, traveling and speaking to others. He realized he was attracted to both women and men in high school and was kicked out by his grandmother when she discovered him holding hands with and androgynous person. Having to rebuild his life from nothing without family, he put himself through college without much support, leading to loneliness, depression, and a suicide attempt at 20, overdosing on pills. After surviving the attempt, a voice emanating from within him told him that he was loved. He went into deep prayer for a while and came up with a 7-year plan for himself to recover. He started studying psychology, relationships, communication, spirituality, religion, Theology, philosophy, etc. to reach and understand love and God. He finished undergrad and began creating his own life, graduating with a couple of masters. At 28 in 2009 after his mother passed away and after he married a woman, his friend told him about trans identity, and, finally, he had a word that described himself. Knowing Richardson wanted to medically and socially transition, his partner realized she wanted something different and left the relationship. Richardson, left again to rebuild his life, moved in with his friend who told him about trans identity. Since then he had top surgery, a hysterectomy, an oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy, metoidioplasty, and has gone through the first stages of phalloplasty. He is a United Church of Christ pastor at Linden Hills UCC and a digital media strategist, creating a position for himself called digital evangelism. As a black trans man, he’s terrified of the police, living with the reality that they will shoot him down as a suspicious threat.

Her sister, on the other hand, had her own room since the rooms were divided by gender. Unable to fully be herself since she was expected to perform as a boy, she preferred being alone and she describes herself as a socially awkward introvert who is always in her own head. Her father worked in public service, working as communications director for the governor and then later working in redevelopment, while her mom was a stay at home mom well into Keisling’s teen years. Hiding the shame of being transgender for decades, Keisling lived with the fear of rejection and violence, but, for the most part, avoided both since she was privileged in some ways, such as being a middle-class white educated person. However, she is a 6’2” tall trans woman, drawing attention to her that “knocked [her] down a couple pegs in the privilege ladder.” To access trans information, such as a list of support groups and conferences along with trans stories, she would buy Tapestry from porn shops. It was a magazine that the International Foundation for Gender Education published. In 1996, Keisling worked up the nerve to attend the Fantasia Fair conference in Provincetown, Massachusetts and then in 1998 she went to the Southern Comfort Conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Attending these trans conferences led to an emotional epiphany to transition in 2009. She received electrolysis to remove her beard. She recounts that trans support groups in the late nineties said that if you came out, “You’re going to lose your job. You’re going to lose your family. You’re going to lose your home. And if you keep any of those, count your blessings.” She did lose a couple of clients and a couple of people in her life but everyone else was amazing. She came out in her late 30s by writing a 27-page document to her parents who were supportive of her transition, her mom even naming her Mara. She is the Executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, or NCTE, a trans advocacy organization primarily in Washington, D.C. that works on policy and public education. She talks about the recent election of Trump and his administration as a threat to the trans community and to human rights.","White Transgender Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Introvert; Gender Performance; Socially Awkward; Shame; Rejection; Violence; Avoidance; Middle Class White Privilege; Tapestry Magazine; Porn Shops; International Foundation for Gender Education; Fantasia Fair; Provincetown, Massachusetts; Southern Comfort Conference; Atlanta, Georgia; Trans Conferences; Electrolysis; Trans Support Groups; Loss; Coming Out; National Center for Transgender Equality; Washington, d.c.; Policy; Donald Trump; Human Rights; Creating Change Conference; Chelsea Manning",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:49

Owen discusses recognizing Owen’s identity in a New York University graduate school program and the difficulties of not having language to describe identity right away. Owen shares experiences from emotional and physical abuse at home as a child; the difficulty of living beyond a gender binary but being read within one; experiences with masculinity; the issues with gender essentialism and that which exists in trans communities; transitioning; to building community and creating chosen family within the Twin Cities. Owen has been a part of many organizations in the Twin Cities including Gender Blur, the Transgender Health Coalition, and the University of Minnesota’s Transgender Commission. Owen discusses things such as fatness, medical discrimination, dating, vulnerability, the beauty in transgressing gender and its rigid constructs, and shares hopes about continuing intersectional and revolutionary work within queer trans communities so that trans identities and histories can one day be recognized as valid.","Genderqueer; Rochester, Ny; Abuse; Narratives; Nontraditional Narrative; Masculinity; Language; Essentialism; Medical Discrimination; Fatness; Testosterone; Hysterectomy; Gender Blur; Transgender Health Coalition; Transgender Commission; Dating; Queerness; Community; Chosen Family; Intersectionality; Transgender History",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:50
132,Williams_Toni-Michelle,"Williams, Toni-Michelle","Jenkins, Andrea",6/13/2017,"Toni-Michelle Williams is a 26-year-old heterosexual black woman of trans experience from Atlanta, Georgia where she was born. She’s attracted to black men, and she also identifies as a magical black unicorn. She’s the only child of her mother, and she has 4 step-siblings through her father who was murdered when she was 10. Williams’ mother also used to whoop, beat, and strangle her as a child. Her relationship with her mother was a struggle but it improved dramatically after she went through weight loss surgery that helped her understand her child’s need to change her body as she also did. In school at DeKalb School of the Arts, Williams was pretty effeminate, hung out with girls, often got in trouble for talking and cursing all the time, and struggled with a deep sense of shame surrounding her gender. She also struggled relating to gay men and men in general, preferring instead the company of women. She came out in high school and transitioned in Norfolk, Virginia while in college at Norfolk State University. In college she worked for an AIDS service organization for trans women, ACCESS AIDS Health Care, where she ran a support group called T Girls Empowerment. She also studied for seven months in Czech Republic, and she was president of Leading the Education of Gay and Straight Individuals. As a result, she was invited to the White House for Obama’s Emerging Leaders Initiative with the National Black Justice Coalition. She moved back home in 2015 to live with her mother but it wasn’t the right place for her since she felt trapped and drained there. She’s currently a community organizer and internship coordinator with Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative in Atlanta, a black trans-led abolitionist organization that wages campaigns to fight the criminal justice system. She’s been on hormone therapy for about three years now, and she aspires to proceed with gender-affirming surgeries. She attended the Sojourner Truth Leadership Circle Fellowship dedicated to the self-care of black trans women. She dreams of having a house on the east side of Atlanta with two acres of land or more.","Black Woman; Trans Woman; Atlanta, Georgia; Abuse; De Kalb School of the Arts; Effeminate; Shame; Norfolk, Virginia; Norfolk State University; Access Aids Health Care; T Girls Empowerment; Czech Republic; Leading the Education of Gay and Straight Individuals; White House; Obama; Emerging Leaders Initiative With the National Black Justice Coalition; Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative; Abolition; Criminal Justice System; Hormone Therapy; Transition Related Surgery; Sojourner Truth Leadership Circle Fellowship",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:51

Their parents are both school teachers and divorced when schneider was 3. They have a sister, a half-sister, and two step-sisters. schneider grew up exhibiting cross-gender behavior, but they never felt like there was anything wrong with their body as a child. They came out in college during their senior year as a lesbian woman first to a Catholic nun who was a wonderful college instructor at St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota. They came out as genderqueer during their master’s program. Since starting hormones and having top surgery, they have become more interested in expressing femininity. They have considered possibly going off testosterone since they may at some point feel it’s not necessary anymore. schneider is now often assumed to be a straight cis guy. They are a university instructor. They’ve dealt with misgendering, microaggressions, and medical practitioners saying awful things about them being trans. schneider’s family reacted pretty well when they came out. Their family responded with, “We love you and who you are is who you are.” One big fear of theirs is being unlovable for being trans. After they stopped identifying as a woman, their relationship during the time ended because of it. They worried about their current partner leaving them when they were deciding to go on testosterone.

She was born and raised in Los Angeles, California in the suburbs. She had an older brother who was murdered when she was 4. She remembers her physically abusive father beating her mother when she was a child. When she was 2 her parents divorced, and she lived primarily with her mother where her great aunt helped raise her. Spencer loves her mother dearly and currently lives with her. She describes her childhood as innocent and playful, skipping through the neighborhood and picking flowers on the way. In kindergarten, they were playing dress up, and she automatically went to the girl’s box. Her teacher called her mother who told her it was fine for Spencer to play in the girl’s box. She hid and isolated a lot as a child since she knew she wasn’t safe. People responded to her differently, which made her feel unsafe. Her father attempted to violently instill masculinity into Spencer from a young age by expressing rage towards her, but she describes herself as a soft, frail child. Her father wanted her to be a boxer like he was and to be his son. He took her to a playboy club to butch her up but failed. She hasn’t spoken to her father since she was 16. She was put out of churches and picked on and beat up by the neighborhood because of her femininity. Spencer came of age in the 1980s and came out through the gay experience. Spencer says she was raised by “old bulldaggers and faggots” during her late twenties. She became a drag queen after her friends suggested it. Her mother even helped her purchase fabric, gave her money, and took her to get her nails done for her first drag show. Her mother and her grandmother even attended the show, thrilled to be there. By 17, she began to feel that she wasn’t a drag queen. Her doctor suspected that she might be trans and so referred her to a support group at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center where she discovered that she was trans. She began transitioning with her mother’s help by changing her name and wearing feminine clothing full-time. She has a Master’s in Social Work and is close to finishing her doctorate at One Spirit Interfaith Seminary based in New York, studying to be an interfaith minister. She was honored by the White House and was invited to meet Caitlyn Jenner, but she declined the invitation.

There were born on a naval base in Yokosuka, Japan. They grew up in San Diego, California in a Navy family. In elementary school they got in trouble a lot for talking in class and for not paying attention. Their parents separated when they were 8. Hoagland then moved into the projects with their mother and sisters. They always knew they were different, and they were a tomboy. It was important to their parents for Hoagland to “be a good Christian girl,” wear dresses, meet a man, get married, and have kids, but it never stuck. Their dad knew they weren’t straight, and they dated women which he knew about. They stopped talking to their dad right before graduating with their PhD since Hoagland says he got mean about their identity. In 1995, their mom, who suffered with depression and an undiagnosed mental illness, died after a car accident when Hoagland was 24. They became closer to their sisters afterwards who both accept Hoagland. They identify the masculine parts of themselves as the effeminate parts, such as their limp wristed expression. They had a breast reduction at the University of Minnesota in 2007, and they changed their name legally in Minnesota as well. They’ve been stopped twice by police for being black while walking. They are now married to a cisgender woman who’s butch, and they have been with their partner for 6 years now.

164,OBrien_Tracie,"O'Brien, Tracie Jada","Jenkins, Andrea",1/13/2017,"Tracie Jada O’Brien identifies as an African American female and was assigned male at birth. She was 65 at the time of the interview. She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri in the 1950s and 1960s in an all African American neighborhood. Her mother and father never married, and she lived with her mother until she was 5 and then was raised by her father’s parents with her two older siblings. She remembers feeling different, abandoned, disconnected, lost, and lonely afterwards. Her father also died when she was 8. She grew up in the church and enjoyed Gospel Choir. Always feeling female from a young age, she expressed it and learned that being effeminate wasn’t tolerated. Her brother felt embarrassed because he had to stick up for O’Brien who was picked on. O’Brien describes herself as a small, chubby child who was afraid and nervous, not wanting to be beaten up or taken advantage of. Since she sprouted up to 6’3” at 14, however, no one bothered her. She became a “tall lanky cissy silly person” as the class clown and everyone loved her. She had a wonderful time growing up but that silent part of herself kept her in pain and kept her isolated from everybody else. Only the occasional touch or affection she received on the street or with other boys who she played with as a kid gave her some sense of herself. She didn’t know what was happening. At 14, however, she knew her destiny would be female when she found a book on Christine Jorgensen’s life. When she got a job at 15 as a busboy at IHOP, she discovered the nightlife of St. Louis such as the Gaslamp Quarter in the 1960s and the jazz and blues scene. She describes how she saw prostitutes, pimps, people dressed as females who weren’t females, and drag queens. She hung out with other cissies, wearing pea coats with permed hair. They ran for their lives, getting chased down the street by people who would throw rocks, bricks, and glass bottles at them. Her entire life she’s experienced bullying, people calling her a faggot, cissy, and punk. She didn’t tell anyone about it, keeping it all in. She was sexually molested by her stepbrother as well. She didn’t recognize it as molestation at the time, however, and saw it as an affirmation of her femininity. She was confused about herself and now sees how unfortunate it is that gender-variant people don’t have a place of nurturance and understanding. Trying to fit in as a girl, her height at 6’3” kept her depressed and so she stopped eating. She went to Miss Fannie’s Ball in St. Louis, which was a drag queen ball where she met others in drag. One person in drag told O’Brien about San Francisco where she had sex for money. O’Brien moved back in with her mom at 17. Her mom was strict and told O’Brien she couldn’t use the front door nor have her friends over. She also told O’Brien she had to go to beautician school “because that’s what you folks do.” O’Brien followed her mom’s rules, but she didn’t feel whole, so she moved to San Francisco, California in 1970 to look for a place to belong. She stayed with some other girlfriends of hers who lived there. Once there, she began hormones that she received from the Center for Special Problems in San Francisco and changed her name and gender marker. She found the bars, drugs, and a whole new way of life. She describes herself as a bar girl, a show girl, a hooker, and went to jail after police would clear out the bar. She even met Sylvester with the Cockettes. She enjoyed all of it, but she also didn’t know she could be anything else as a trans woman. She came to San Diego, California in 1980 and continued to be a hooker. She was deeply depressed, not seeing any way out, and got involved in drug use and the nightlife there for the next 10 years, being thrown into jail repeatedly in the “queen’s tank” where they put effeminate queens. She ended up at Stepping Stone in San Diego, a drug and alcohol program that helped her get on hormones and get herself back together. After Stepping Stone, she went to City College and started a professional career as a counselor at Stepping Stone.","African American Female; Assigned Male at Birth; In St. Louis, Missouri; African American Neighborhood; Feeling Different; Church; Gospel Choir; Class Clown; Isolation; Depression; Touch; Christine Jorgensen; Ihop; Busboy; St. Louis Nightlife; Gaslamp Quarter; Prostitutes; Pimps; Drag Queens; Cissy; Bullying; Street Harassment; Slurs; Sexual Assault; Miss Fannie’s Ball; Drag Queen Ball; Beautician School; San Francisco, California; Hormones; Name Change; Gender Marker",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:56

Their family didn’t make much money with their mom being the primary decision maker of the house. Olson got a BMX bike as a kid and got their first mullet afterwards. While in grade school, they came out when they were 15 resulting in trauma and difficulty making close friends and intimate connections. They’ve struggled a bit understanding their non-binary identity. Olson is from a religious family and grew up going to church and wanting to be a minister. Their dad told them they were going to hell after Olsen came out, and they were sent to Christian counseling to fix them. Olson’s siblings now accept them, becoming LGBTQ champions and advocates. Olson went to Chatham College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an all-women’s college. There they experienced riot-girl feminism in 1997 and became a performance artist after receiving a theater scholarship. They couldn’t finish their undergraduate degree until years later because they didn’t have the money. Olson now also has a master’s as well.

They were born in Iowa City, Iowa and raised in Muscatine, Iowa and North Liberty, Iowa. He has a younger half-sister who he helped take care of as a kid. In college at MSUM, Minnesota State University Moorhead in Minneapolis, Nemo learned about his indigenous Mexican identity and how colonialism has stripped away the indigenous concepts concerning third and non-binary genders that were revered and respected. They also talk about teaching “white people about the effects of white supremacy and how in this system we’re not meant to be friends or family. We’re not meant to be interacting with each other and that’s why white people are so isolated.” Nemo was a volunteer at the Rainbow Dragon Center, an LGBTQ Center at MSUM, as well. They identified more strongly with male figures in anime as a kid, and as they grew up they began to not care what they were dressed in, whether boy’s or girl’s clothing. In high school he became aware of his sexual identity, coming out as bisexual, and then in college he came out as trans. Even though it took a while for his mom to stop using his birth name and to use his new name, she was instantly supportive, helping him socially transition. He’s also autistic and has been harassed and bullied for it. While living in North Liberty as a 7 or 8-year-old, some kids beat and stripped Nemo. As a result, their mom is protective of them. They believe their autism made it easier to acknowledge that there isn’t a gender binary since autistic people generally “don’t care about what other people think” and so it’s easier for them to “see the truth a lot quicker.”","Trans Man; Demisexual; Assigned Female at Birth; Iowa City, Iowa; Muscatine, Iowa; North Liberty, Iowa; Msum; Minnesota State University Moorhead; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Mexican; Indigenous; Colonialism; Third Gender; Non Binary; White Supremacy; Rainbow Dragon Center; Lgbtq Center; Anime; Bisexual; Social Transition; Autism; Bullying; Harassment",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:63

She took her wife’s last name to fully express how meaningful her wife and her wife’s family’s acceptance of her every stage along the way. She lived in Metairie, Louisiana at a young age and in England and New York. She spent her formative years in central Texas. She had an abusive upbringing, including sexual, emotional, and physical abuse. She also explains there was emotional incest where she was “saddled with the emotional obligations of a primary relationship” with her mother. She learned to hide well and walk within very narrow lines otherwise face swift and brutal punishment from her parents. She was often gendered as a girl by strangers. Her mother would get frustrated and correct them, telling them Zakariasen was a boy. She experienced bullying in school in Texas since she was smart. Her parents divorced, and she was free of her father’s authority and free to be whoever she wanted to be. She is no longer in contact with either of her parents now. She came out as bi in high school in the 1980s since she was looking for a way to say she wasn’t a man but didn’t have to vocabulary to articulate it further than that. She soon started identifying as queer as soon as she read William S. Burroughs since it was more of an umbrella term. Zakariasen says that as she began to resolve her issues with men, she found more men attractive and felt more comfortable around some men, more willing to give them a chance to get emotionally close. After beginning anti-depressants, she wasn’t struggling just to cope and realized she could wear dresses in public and be equipped to deal with expressing her feminine side in 2015. She then began using the label non-binary trans to describe herself. She soon called the Center for Sexual Health at the University of Minnesota to begin hormones, and two rough, emotional days later she realized she was a trans woman, not non-binary.

She grew up in Cannon Falls, Minnesota on a hobby farm on 25 acres with horses, chickens, ducks, a goat, and a few pigs. She has five sisters, and she also has a half-brother and a half-sister. She hid her gender identity while in school and began to cross-dress starting at 9. She preferred to hang out with girls and do girl stuff. Her dad trained her to be a mechanic, and, following in her father’s footsteps to be “the man” to overcompensate for transgender feelings, she pursued more masculine type occupations such as the Army. She also still works out at the gym, coming to accept that it’s okay for girls to have muscles. Her mom is accepting of her identity, but her dad died before she came out. When she was in the Army as a mechanic from 1985-1990, she married a girl and stayed with her for seven years. Her wife knew she cross-dressed but Pagel was in denial, telling herself she’s just a guy who cross-dresses. She began to transition and come out in 2012 when she started therapy and going to a transgender support group, deciding she needed to focus on herself. She legally changed her name, started estrogen and testosterone blockers along with progesterone for a little while, had breast augmentation, and scheduled her gender reassignment surgery. She’s interested in facial hair removal as well. She suffers from anxiety and depression and takes medication for it. She’s involved with Pride Network at her job with Wells Fargo in the Twin Cities who have been incredibly supportive of her transition.

Bradford then moved to a military base in South Korea; Fayetteville, North Carolina; and Fort Knox, Kentucky. She now lives in Atlanta, Georgia. Bradford remembers always being singled out for being more feminine by other kids who would comment on their femininity to their parents. Her parents are pretty good at trying to work to understand her gender transition, going to her drag shows and using she/her pronouns for her, but they also thought having a conversation with family about her gender at Thanksgiving would be a downer. Bradford first came out as bisexual, then gay, queer, non-binary, a woman, and then a queer trans woman. Bradford went to Georgia State University in Atlanta for college where she started organizing. They are the cofounder and organizer of Southern Fried Queer Pride Festival. She’s also a performance artist and values artistic expression.

They would like to transition but they were diagnosed at 18 on their birthday with polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS, which, if not treated, can lead to ovary and pelvic cancer and leads to hormone imbalance. They came out to their mom the next day after their eighteenth birthday, telling her they wanted to transition. Vondal ended up in an argument with their mom since she was afraid for Vondal.

They were also on the student council in school and started one of the first GSAs, Gay Straight Alliances, in Iowa. Even while Koch was Homecoming Queen during senior year of high school, they were still teased and bullied in school for defying gender norms. People told them they were a lesbian so that is how they understood their gender before they knew about queer identity. When they began to develop breasts, they felt disgusted with the idea and wanted them gone. After someone asked them what their pronouns were, they thought about it and decided to start using gender neutral pronouns. They strongly embraced the term butch.

Beech went to school in the little town of Ellendale, Minnesota and lived in Bath, Minnesota. From a young age friends and family picked up on her feminine expressions. She always knew she was a woman and tried to get others to understand. She was a cheerleader in the 1940s in school. During World War II she remembers her family having to ration goods such as sugar, gasoline, and canned goods. She always liked boys for their protective and comforting nature. She went to Augsburg in Minneapolis, Minnesota staying in a dormitory, but she eventually left college. She was bullied by boys in college who called her names such as cocksucker. She became a hairdresser with upper class clientele for 35-40 years. She began going back to school in the evenings to pursue liberal arts. She was with a man named Ronnie for 7 years who was a G.I. that bought a little house in St. Louis Park where the two of them lived together for a while. She’s been on hormones, and she had transition related surgery in 1969 and had her first orgasm after surgery with a man. She then had surgery again to widen her opening for sex but it seemed to have closed up a bit after a year and a half. She also had electrolysis. After legally changing her name to Amanda she began to dress full time as a woman. Since then she has been able to be more herself and to enjoy herself more.","Trans Woman; Assigned Male at Birth; Ellendale, Minnesota; Bath, Minnesota; Cheerleader; World War Ii; Augsburg; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Bullying; Hairdresser; Hormones; Transition Related Surgery; Orgasm; Electrolysis; Legal Name Change",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:75
91,Urban_Tamara,"Urban, Tamara","Jenkins, Andrea",1/22/2017,"Tamara Urban identifies as a transsexual female and was assigned male with an intersex condition when she was born in 1953. She was 63 at the time of the interview. She grew up in Sioux Falls and Flandreau, South Dakota in the 1950s and 1960s. She lived in an apartment above her parent’s jewelry store business. Her parents were loving and caring even while they were busy with the business. She has an older brother that she’s not very close to because of their age difference. She didn’t know she was intersex until an endocrinologist gave her a pelvic exam and told her she had undergone gender assignment surgery as an infant where they sewed her vagina shut, possibly removed her ovaries, and re-routed her urethra so she could pee standing up. She was born with ambiguous genitalia with both a vagina and a small penis. Blood testing proved that she was intersex and showed that her hormones weren’t what they should be for a male. She had very vivid nightmares as a child undergoing surgery, most likely triggered by the gender assignment surgery that she underwent as an infant. She also had hypospadias where the urethra opening isn’t where it’s supposed to be for a male. The condition that her doctors believe she has is Three Beta HSD Deficiency. Unfortunately, her health insurance won’t cover the $7,000 test to prove it. At her fifth birthday party, Urban realized she wasn’t a boy since she noticed her behavior was different from the boys. She was bullied a lot in junior high and high school for being girly. She received testosterone shots around this time but was told they were allergy shots. The testosterone caused facial hair to grow but it didn’t lower her voice, and she never developed an Adam’s Apple. Urban began her transition in 2007 when she came out and started hormone therapy in 2012. She also underwent 236 hours of electrolysis to remove her facial hair. She wants gender reassignment surgery. She didn’t have the opportunity to come out as trans to her parents since both passed away before she could. A friend of hers who was a Native American trans woman was recently murdered, which was quite a shock for Urban. She’s also had trans friends and counseling clients commit or attempt suicide. She never married, and she only dated a little when she was living as a male. She hasn’t dated since transitioning. She’s never actually had consensual sex because of fear, trauma, and since she hasn’t met anyone that she really clicked with. She was molested three times as a child between the ages of 3 and 7. Urban went to college for a couple of years in Iowa studying to become a minister but didn’t finish. She was fired from her job as a cab driver for being transgender, but they told her it was for other reasons. She is now retired but is involved in transgender activism in South Dakota. She is a member of the Board of Directors of Equality South Dakota and is also the President and Founder of Trans Action South Dakota.","Transsexual Female; Assigned Male at Birth; Intersex; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Flandreau, South Dakota; Endocrinologist; Pelvic Exam; Gender Assignment Surgery; Ambiguous Genitalia; Hormones; Nightmares; Hypospadias; Three Beta Hsd Deficiency; Bullying; Testosterone Shots; Facial Hair; Transitioning; Electrolysis; Trans Suicide; Trans Murder; Dating; Sex; Child Molestation; College; Minister; Cab Driver; Retired; Transgender Activism; Board of Directors of Equality South Dakota; Trans Action South Dakota",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:76

Her crossdressing went underground during high school but a couple of years into her marriage after high school, those feelings began to return. Her marriage ended after five years with two kids because of her gender identity. Her first ex-wife dragged Schroeder through the mud, ending with a court appointed psychiatrist evaluating her to be a fit parent. She fought for sole custody and won, however. Five years into her second marriage, she experimented with hormones and realized she wanted to transition. She also had another kid in her second marriage. She made the decision not to transition, however, since she didn’t want to face the consequences and risk her marriage. She took up marathon running and body building, full of rage, depression, and anxiety. She realized she wasn’t happy and began hormones again through underground channels. In 2014, she then began going to Family Tree in St. Paul, Minnesota after experiencing some concerning emotional and physical changes. Her second marriage ended when her ex-wife couldn’t accept Schroeder going through gender reassignment surgery and living full time as a woman. Schroeder also lost her parents, younger brother, and kids. She is close to her 11-year-old daughter, however, who accepts her unconditionally.

She was bullied, talked about, and called names, such as faggot, queer, sissy, gay, and tranny in school. Villagomez wasn’t athletic and was shy and reserved, taking her studies seriously. Villagomez also struggled in school since she was biracial in a predominately white school. She knew something was different about herself and that she was in the wrong body. She was more feminine and secretly knew she was a girl living inside a boy’s body. She once attempted suicide and deals with self-doubt and people in her life who are unsupportive of her as a person and woman. She struggles with depression and self-confidence, dealing with people who are confused by her gender, and she is very reserved in certain aspects of her life in public settings. She’s been out since she was 18 and started wearing more feminine clothing, makeup, and jewelry. She was never comfortable sharing who she was with her family even though she believes they know.

She got a certificate in Women’s and Gender Studies and specialized in Italian as her second language. She always knew she was a woman with a strong feminine energy.

She also talks extensively about Harry Benjamin’s Standards of Care, The World Professional Association for Transgender Health, clinics that support trans issues in the Twin Cities, and becoming gender literacy. She’s involved in transgender health as a therapist and researcher for the Center for Sexual Health Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota. She worked on the Insurance Task Force in Minnesota to put together a policy stating that the health care needs of trans people, such as hormones and surgery, are medically necessary, and, therefore, should be covered by insurance.","Cisgender Woman; Assigned Female at Birth; Femme; Farmington, Missouri; Feminine; Fat Phobia; Feminism; Gender Studies; Activist; Coming Out; Queer; University of Wisconsin; Madison, Wisconsin; Southeast Missouri State; Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Transsexual Menace; Counseling Psychology; Ph D; University of Missouri; Columbia, Missouri; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; Gender Identity Disorder; Gender Dysphoria; Gatekeeping; Harry Benjamin’s Standards of Care; The World Professional Association for Transgender Health; Twin Cities, Minnesota; Transgender Health; Therapist; Researcher; Center for Sexual Health Program in Human Sexuality; University of Minnesota; Insurance Task Force; Policy",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:85

They grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and their family is a mix of Black, Puerto Rican, and indigenous heritage. They were teased in school for speaking some Spanish. They have an older brother and sister. They came out as a lesbian at 19 when they shifted from being a high-femme lesbian to a masculine dyke. Their first girlfriend was a militant dyke who helped Rivera express different parts of themselves and taught them a lot about politics and sexual orientation. They started hormones 2 years ago, had a hysterectomy for medical reasons, and top surgery. After they began passing more when their chest was noticeable, they experienced looks and aggressiveness from people, particularly men. They have a good relationship with their family.

She is half-Korean on her mom’s side and a mixture of Norwegian, Italian and Polish on her father’s side. She uses she/her and they/them pronouns. Paige was born in Burbank, California, a suburb near L.A., and moved 15 or 16 times to various places such as Las Vegas, Nevada; Everett, Washington; and Sedro-Woolley, Washington. Their dad became disabled when they were around eight years old after an accident working for Alaskan crab fishing. She has four siblings, three sisters and a fourth sibling who is a trans guy. At the age of 11, Paige began to develop D cup size breasts leading to a series of doctor visits and talks of needing various surgeries and going on testosterone for a possible intersex condition. Because her family couldn’t afford to pay, Paige bound her breasts every day instead. She began to connect with the idea of being trans around 12 or 13 after accessing the internet. Paige was never particularly masculine, never really developing facial hair and their voice never really dropped. She also wasn’t interested in stereotypical masculine culture such as sports, cars, or being aggressive. She constantly thought about transitioning and really hated her body because she wanted to be normal. She ended up giving up on herself and gaining a lot of weight as a result. Paige learned to love and feel comfortable in her body, however, when they later socially transitioned by growing out their hair, changing their clothing style, going to therapy, and leaving behind the expectation to be a part of toxic masculine society. She’s also on hormones but hasn’t had any surgeries to date. She is a legal assistant at Lambda Legal living in Chicago, Illinois. They’ve also worked at the Cascade AIDS Project and volunteered with places like LGBTQ community centers and transgender working groups for different advocacy organizations such as Basic Rights Oregon and Trans Lifeline.","Trans Woman; Bisexual; Queer; Assigned Male at Birth; Korean; Burbank, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Everett, Washington; Sedro Woolley, Washington; Trans Siblings; Breast Development; Intersex; Breast Binding; Internet; Toxic Masculinity; Therapy; Social Transition; Hormones; Legal Assistant; Lambda Legal; Chicago, Illinois; Cascade Aids Project; Lgbtq Community Centers; Transgender Working Groups; Basic Rights Oregon; Trans Lifeline",en,https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll97:87

He grew up in Boston, Massachusetts and was adopted as a baby by his parents. Around the age of 7 or 8 they moved to Minnesota. He grew up always wanting to take his shirt off, play in the dirt, and not deal with girly stuff. He remembers feeling like a man or boy even at the age of 3. He doesn’t have any girl memories, he explains. He didn’t dress up or style his hair. Instead he played with trucks and GI Joes, played in the mud, and always wanted to be around boys. In school he states that he was an openly gay woman dating girls, dressing as a “thugged out” dude with short hair, sagging pants, and no belt. He identified as a lesbian, then as a stud. He felt like he wanted something more, however. He went to school at Everest Institute in Eagan, Minnesota to be a medical assistant. He didn’t like working as a medical assistant, however, and so he started delivering dry cleaning, worked for Uber, and then settled into being a PCA, which he loves. After college he began to figure things out. After he met a white trans guy who explained transitioning to him, he was shocked and no longer felt like he was crazy. He saw Boys Don’t Cry previously but he didn’t realize transitioning and going on hormones was a possibility. He then called the University of Minnesota Center for Sexual Health and got a therapist who suggested going on hormones to him. He started working out and now is into competitive bodybuilding. Two months later he started testosterone. He’s now been on testosterone for 3 years. He now feels comfortable and safe knowing that he’s doing what he needs to do for himself. He also had top surgery and has no plans for bottom surgery. He’s in the process of getting his hysterectomy. He calls Buck Angel his dad. Buck Angel is an adult film star who is a mentor to Chilko. He’s on good terms with his adopted family who accept him. Chilko is aslo featured in a documentary about trans male bodybuilders called Man Made.

She became more aware of her intersex condition at the age of 11 or 12 when her doctor noticed she wasn’t growing. She was sent to a specialist in endocrinology where she found out she had Turner’s Syndrome, a condition where you are born with a partial, smaller X chromosome. The doctors also found that she wasn’t starting puberty, so they started her on daily growth hormone injections for 3 years.

His gender is very fluid but also grounded in being trans masculine. They prefer he/him and they/them pronouns. He doesn’t identify as a Christian but has Christian roots. He was born in Rochester, Minnesota at the Mayo Clinic in 1997 and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They describe themselves as “the queer, kind of goofy, really clumsy child in the family.” They were bullied a lot in sixth grade since everyone knew they were a dyke before they did. They came out shortly after that as bisexual, then identified with being a stud, and then as a stem, and then as queer. When he got into basketball he felt more connected to his family who enjoyed basketball. The more masculine Porter presented, the more conscious he is of his aggressive and protective side. He’s noticed that he’s treated more roughly when he’s perceived as a black woman in stores or elsewhere, but when he’s perceived to be a black man people are more hands-off and threated by his aggressive side than before. During sophomore year of high school, he battled mental illness, depression, and paranoia since he believed he was going to hell for his sexuality. Porter began going to the GSA at his school where he found out about trans identity. After that he began researching online, particularly on Tumblr, and reaching out to the community more through activism. He went to a program called, “An Evening Out,” where queer and trans kids get together to make dinner, play basketball, do crafts, and other activities. While working with OutFront and the national GSA Network, they asked him to testify in front of the high school league on Prop 9 at a Minnesota State Senate hearing committee. After the bill was passed, Porter was asked to be on the Governor’s Task Force. He won an award from OutFront Minnesota as the Youth Advocate of the Year and the Courage Award as well. He’s also been involved with the Black Lives Matter movement, Standing Rock, and other movements for social justice. He enjoys writing poetry.

They were born and raised in Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota which Metcalf describes as rural and isolating since they couldn’t find people like themselves. Their parents divorced when they were 14, and they have 3 biological siblings, 4 adopted, and 6 step-siblings. They were bullied in school and so hung out with more effeminate people or girls who protected Metcalf. Socialized predominately around women growing up, it was difficult to relate to men. They are a survivor of both domestic violence and sexual assault. For a long time, they considered transitioning and hormones but then decided against medical transition since presenting as male provides a sense of safety and because they are focused on taking care of their son. They were involved with drag as an adult and loved it but also struggled feeling safe in drag since they were treated differently by men. They struggle to fit into the gay men’s community and the trans community since both don’t capture their two spirit identity. They explain that native and indigenous communities have multiple genders based on their function in community, the roles performed, and what they do for community as opposed to being strictly based on body parts. They talk about queer white culture, colonization, acculturation in Minnesota, and the importance of holding space for people of color. They were President of the Gay Student Association their senior year of college. They moved to the Twin Cities in 1994 to be more involved with two spirit organizing, such as the American Indian Movement. They soon met Richard LaFortune and became a case manager for people living with HIV. Metcalf ran Minnesota Men of Color, which was open from 1997-2004.

Their Puerto Rican mom was a single mom finishing college while they were an only child. He didn’t grow up around his father who is black. They’ve been to Puerto Rico several times, and they love going there. His mom is in a relationship with a man who has ten kids, 5 of whom are white and five who are black. Their mom encouraged education and independence, so Alexander went to public and magnet schools and went to school 6 days a week and joined summer programs. He grew up as “a mix girl with long hair and light skin.” They say they were nerdy, weird, and liked boy things. Others told them they were loud and too aggressive. Alexander’s mom policed his gender, not allowing him to cut his hair or get involved in masculine activities resulting in him not interacting with men too much. In an all-girls high school, they began to realize they were gay. He went to a women’s college at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and began identifying as a lesbian and then as queer when that didn’t feel right. They didn’t realize trans people existed until they met a Korean trans man in New York freshmen year of college. He dated women and then started hooking up with trans guys. They started going to a support group for trans men of color who pressured Alexander to transition. He wasn’t comfortable at the time transition since they struggled understanding how they could be a man. They did start testosterone though when he came to discover that the more aesthetically masculine he became, the more he could be feminine in a way that he didn’t have access to before.

He had to grow up early and be the “man of the house” due to his absent father. She watched her mother struggle to support them.

They were assigned female at birth and grew up in Anderson, Indiana. Growing up they preferred playing male figures such as the uncle or dad as opposed to playing as women with their friends. Their mom referred to them as a tomboy when they were little which validated their masculine presence. When they got to high school after moving to Spencer, Indiana they were athletic, and it was okay for them to have muscles, to run and jump off stuff, ride their skateboard, and have a BMX bike. By senior year of high school, all their girlfriends had boyfriends and spent a lot of time in the mirror applying make-up. Anytime their girlfriends applied makeup on them, Anderson felt weird, the sort of weird they were accustomed to when their mom made them wear a dress and pantyhose to church. It felt like crossdressing or drag to them. Being “read” as a black man or appearing to be a black man, they have been slammed over the hood of their trunk more than once by the police and security after being profiled. They also sometimes have to prove they’re in the right bathroom if they use the women’s bathroom, so they prefer gender neutral bathrooms. Sometimes with their more feminine or feminist friends or with others in general, they are seen and judged as butch or masculine. They also state that the trans feminine community developed over a longer period of time than the trans masculine community. Anderson has been involved in trans and gender non-conforming advocacy for decades. They were involved in a public hearing through the Minnesota Department of Education to pass the usage of a toolkit for educators and teachers on how to deal with trans and gender non-conforming students. One of the speakers there said, “You know, trans women will never be real women and trans men are not real men.” This statement got to Anderson and when it was their turn to speak they stood up for the trans community. They’ve been employed by OutFront, District 202, and the Minnesota Men of Color, three major LGBT institutions in the Twin Cities. Anderson was part of the advisory board and later a grantee of Rainbow Health Initiative, and they were also engaged with Twin Cities Pride as the conveyer of the Power to the People area.
