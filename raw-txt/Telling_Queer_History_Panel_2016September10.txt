Speakers Rebecca Lawrence Lisa Vecoli Andrea Jenkins Phillipe Cunningham Lane Cunningham The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota October 9, 2016 The Transgender Oral History Project of the Upper Midwest will empower individuals to tell their story, while providing students, historians, and the public with a more rich foundation of primary source material about the transgender community. The project is part of the Tretter Collection at the University of Minnesota. The archive provides a record of GLBT thought, knowledge and culture for current and future generations and is available to students, researchers and members of the public. The Transgender Oral History Project will collect up to 400 hours of oral histories involving 200 to 300 individuals over the next three years. Major efforts will be the recruitment of individuals of all ages and experiences, and documenting the work of The Program in Human Sexuality. This project will be led by Andrea Jenkins, poet, writer, and trans-activist. Andrea brings years of experience working in government, non-profits and LGBT organizations. If you are interested in being involved in this exciting project, please contact Andrea.

[Laughs]. Oh. That works. Uhm, hello, thank you for coming today. My name is 20 Rebecca. Uh, I use she/her pronouns, and I’m the founder of Queer History. Uhm, so I’m gonna 21 go through a couple of things, and, uhm, get us all started. So, first of all, thank you to the 22 Tretter Collection for hosting us again our third October in a row. So Queer History month. So, 23 uhm, I’m really happy to be apart of this. 24 25 [audience claps]. 26 27 RL: Uhm, this is our third year of Telling Queer History. Three and a half years going, and, uhm, 28 Telling Queer History started with a desire to spark conversations across generations and 29 identities with queer folks as a way to build more community, uhm, and bring us together and 30 bring in some of our history, uh, especially as activists wanting to know how we got to this point 31 and how we can move forward stronger. Uhm, we hope that you take home some of the stories 32 and lessons that you learn. Am I speaking up loud enough? 33 34 [Audience says yes]. 35 36 RL: Uhm, so we hope that you take home some of the stories and the lessons that you learn here. 37 Feel free to share those, but we ask that you leave the details and names out unless you ask for 38 consent. We wanna create this as a safe and vulnerable space for all of us. Uhm, we believe that 39 listening is an action and a very important action so, uhm, please know that listening is a strong 40 part of storytelling. And we also like to use storytelling as a place of healing and remembering so 41 as a way you can bring that into practice here and outside of this. Uhm, there’s some 42 housekeeping stuff. Are you going to go over that? 43 44 LV: I can. 45 46 RL: Uhm, anything else we need to know. Uh, our next gathering will be in December. December 47 11th, and I believe we are at the Central Library again. And we’re going to talk about chosen Telling Queer History 4 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota family. It’s a time where family can be both welcoming and non-welcoming 1 so we’re going to 2 bring that topic into our queer selves. So please join us again for that. Uhm, and I’m going to 3 pass the mic now. 4 5 LV: Hi everyone, my name is Lisa Vecoli. I am the curator of the Tretter Collection in Gay, Lesbian, 6 Bisexual, and Transgender Studies, which is located here in Andersen Library. We’re part of the 7 University of Minnesota Libraries, and we’re delighted to have you join us today. I’m gonna take 8 just a minute to do housekeeping and to tell you briefly about the archive, and then we’ll, uh, 9 we’ll get going. Uhm, the restrooms are over in that corner. We put up the signs for gender 10 neutral restrooms. Uhm, if you would prefer to use a gendered restroom we have them up 11 second floor so you’re welcome to go up there. We are tapping today cause we are an archive, 12 and we are trying to preserve things. The camera will be pointed at the panel, not the audience 13 so you will not be captured unless you come up here and sit in the chairs during the question 14 and answers. If you have any concerns about asking a question or having your voice on the, 15 uhm, camera, uhm, let us know, and I think any of us would be happy to read a question out 16 loud for you if you wanted to do it that way. So, the Tretter Collection is one of about a dozen 17 different archives in this building. Immigration history, Upper Midwest Jewish Archive, uhm, 18 African American literature, Architecture, uh, Children’s literature, world’s largest Sherlock 19 Holmes Collection [audience laughs] right here. Who knew? Right? Now you know. It’s not on 20 the quiz but now you know. Uhm, we have amazing materials in all the different archives. And 21 the Tretter Collection is one of those. We are enormously fortunate at the university to have 22 dedicated GLBT archives with materials just about the GLBT community. So if you were going to 23 study a community of people, whoever they might be, you would probably want to read what 24 had been written about them, and what they had written about themselves. So we have books. 25 We have magazines. We have periodicals. We have newsletters, things that other people have 26 written about the GLBT community, things that GLBT people has written. We have thousands 27 and thousands and thousands of issues of periodicals. Minnesota periodicals, national 28 periodicals, even international periodicals. Again, if you were studying a community, you would 29 probably want to know how that community came together to form organizations. So what did 30 they come together, what were their issues that they were working on? How did they come 31 together to try and organize? What did they do around entertainment and spirituality and, and 32 community building? So we have organizational records from Twin Cities Pride, Outfront 33 Minnesota, Minnesota AIDS Project, uh, the Bisexual Organizing Project, and many other. We 34 have a small amount of records from, uh, the Trans Youth Support Network, TYSN. If any of you 35 have any of those older records and need to archive them, please come talk to me. Uhm, so we 36 want to know that. And finally, when you’re studying a group of people, we would want to know 37 what the experience was of the people in that community. So we have the records of 38 community members, individuals. And you would want to know both the famous people but 39 also just kind of the average people. So event fliers, letters, posters of events people went to, 40 journals, pictures, any of those kinds of things. So we have all of that documentation too from 41 people like Karen Clark or Scott Dibble, uhm, and Beth Zemsky to people whose names you’ve 42 never heard but they just saved things and gave them to use. So all told, I have thirty-five 43 hundred linear feet of material about the GLBT community. That’s the boxes, those brown boxes 44 that we set up side by side, not even long way, I’ve been cheating, not even long way but 45 narrow way. It would stretch well over a half mile. Millions and millions of pages of content of 46 stories about the GLBT community. When I started working here one of the things I realized is 47 that we have this much information about gay, white, cisgender men [holds out arm very wide]. Telling Queer History 5 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota And we have this much information about lesbians [makes small circle 1 with hands close 2 together], people of color [makes smaller circle with hands], trans community [makes even 3 smaller circle], and the bi, pan, omi community we have the least [even smaller circle]. So the 4 last, uhm, five years that I’ve been here, I’ve really tried to prioritize adding content from 5 underrepresented voices. And that’s part of how we were able to raise the money and initial the 6 Trans Oral History Project that you’re going to hear about today so that’s a really exciting way 7 for us to add voices to the archive. It’s not a problem that we just have. It’s a problem that every 8 archive has. Uhm, so that’s kind of what I wanted to say. I will be here afterwards. I have some 9 samples of materials from the archives over there. I’d be happy to talk to you about the archive, 10 show you some things, so feel free to track me down afterwards if you have questions about 11 what we have or how to use the archive. We are open to everyone. Back to you Rebecca. 12 13 RL: Uh, so we’re gonna do a little ice breaker. So tiny practice of meeting somebody else and being 14 a little bit vulnerable, just a little. Uhm, so this is, this is our traditional ice breaker format. We’re 15 gonna say your name to somebody and you have to do this to somebody you don’t know. Uh, 16 your name and your pronoun choices, uhm, how you heard about Telling Queer History, and our 17 question is, a little abstract and fun, what inanimate object describes your gender in this 18 moment? For example [audience laughs], my gender is going to be this t-shirt that I am wearing 19 because it is an extra large boys t-shirt with not enough room for my hips. That is my gender 20 right now. So it can be whatever you need it to be. Uhm, so will you please now turn to 21 somebody you haven’t met. You’re gonna do that and introduce yourself, and then you’re 22 gonna meet two other people. So you and your new person will turn to another couple and 23 meet three people today. You’ll pretty much meet half the room. ‘Kay? So go ahead and try 24 that. Thank you. [Break for the introductions]. Next, we’re gonna get to the reason you’re here. 25 Here some more stories. So did you wanna do the introductions or we’re just gonna hand it right 26 off to Andrea? 27 28 LV: I can, I can introduce. 29 30 RL: Great. We’re gonna do this 31 32 LV: Uh, so we are here today to hear about the Tretter Collection’s Transgender Oral History 33 Project. The collection was fortunate enough to get a major grant to do a three year project to 34 record the stories and experiences of the transgender community in the Upper Midwest. And 35 we’re also very fortunate to be able to hire Andrea Jenkins who has been, uh, tremendous 36 presence and activist and leader in the transgender community. [Audience claps]. So Andrea 37 came to the Tretter Collection just to do this project, and she is going to, uh, take over now and 38 introduce the panelists, and then they’re just going to blow our socks off. [Laughs]. 39 40 AJ: No pressure there right? Uhm, so yeah, my name is Andrea Jenkins, and, uhm, I am the, uhm, 41 Oral Historian for the Tretter Collection, Transgender Oral History Project. And, you know, we 42 gotta be careful how we say that name because there are other trans oral history projects 43 around the country and so how we distinguish ourselves and, uhm, make sure that people are 44 aware of who we are. Uhm, and so we’re the Tretter Collection Transgender Oral History 45 Project. Uhm, I’ve been doing it for about eighteen months now. Uh, started April 2015. Uhm, 46 put together a kickass advisory committee that, uhm, is pretty representative of a broad range 47 of the trans community as well as allies and, uhm, academics and educators, uhm, oral Telling Queer History 6 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota historians. The, the advisory committee, we work together to sort 1 of pick out the equipment 2 and come up with questions that we thought were gonna be really pertinent, uhm, to preserve 3 for, uhm, posterity. Uhm, and this is an amazing resource. Lisa told you guys all about it but it’s 4 really, uhm, a wonderful opportunity to collect these stories and be able to have them 5 preserved in such, uhm, uhm, state of the art, really, uhm, facility that really doesn’t exist too 6 many places else in the country or in the world for that matter. And so it’s really fortunate to 7 have this project happening here at this time. A very exciting time in the transgender 8 community. I think with, uhm, so much increased visibility around transgender people and 9 transgender issues. Uhm, it also has created some backlash too. Uhm, you know, there’s been a 10 tremendous upswing in violence against trans women of color, trans people of color, uhm, just 11 this weekend, the 22nd trans person of color, trans woman of color was found murdered. And so 12 I think that’s why this project and sharing our stories and telling our stories are so important. 13 We really have to get people to become aware of the humanity of the transgender community. 14 And, and not continue to view the community as, uhm, as marinized, as outcasts, as separate 15 from the full spectrum of humanity. And that’s not to say that we want to necessarily normalize 16 ourselves or at least maybe I should only speak for myself but, uhm, but we want to humanize 17 ourselves. And I think by telling our stories and sharing our stories is a really important and 18 effective way to do that. So, you know, we got all our stuff together. Uhm, and we just started 19 interviewing people, man. And today I have conducted 99 interviews. [Audience in awe and 20 claps]. It is incredible. Amazing. Uhm, 99 interviews with really amazing people, each and every 21 one of them representing a broad, uhm, spectrum of community from genderqueer to gender 22 fluid, to, uhm, trannies cause that’s how some people self identify, to, uhm, you know, binary 23 male to female married to a cisgender man with adopted kids, to queer, gay, trans men who are 24 married to each other. Like that is the spectrum of the stories that we are collecting in this, uhm, 25 in this project. Disabled trans people. Uhm, trans people of color. Uhm, Muslim, uhm, women 26 identified, male identified, it’s, it’s just a really, uhm, amazing, uhm, collection of voices and 27 stories. People who you will know their names instantly like Kate Bornstein, uhm, to folks you 28 have never heard of, uhm, living in rural areas around this state or others states in the Upper 29 Midwest. And so, uhm, yeah, again it’s just a really major honor and, uhm, to be able to share 30 these stories, collect these stories, and, uhm, and, actually just get to meet the people. Uhm, 31 that’s probably the most enjoyable aspect of this whole project. Uhm, and two of the people 32 that I have met, actually I knew them prior to this project. So two of the people I got to know 33 much more intimately and deeply in conducting this project. It is, uh, Philippe Cunningham and 34 Lane Cunningham. And they are going to be our guests’ panelists, uh, today. They were both 35 interviewed individually for the project and shared some really, uhm, brilliant insights into the 36 community as a whole, but also some deep, uh, deeply personal, uhm, stories about 37 themselves. So we’re gonna welcome them up. Uh, Lane has been, uh, volunteered in the 38 project and helping out with some of the, uhm, some of the video and, uhm, technology aspects 39 of the, of the work. Uhm, and I’m very, very grateful for your assistance in that regard. Uhm, and 40 Phillipe is, uhm, the, uhm, Policy Aid, to, uhm, Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges working on, 41 uhm, Youth and Education Issues, LGBT issues, and a whole host of other issues. I just read an 42 amazing article about you, uh, over the weekend so we’re going to ask you a little bit about that. 43 Uhm, so without any further ado please welcome our panelists today. Phillipe and Lane 44 Cunningham. [Audience claps]. So how are you guys doing today? 45 46 LC: I’m doing very well. Thank you so much for having us Andrea. 47 Telling Queer History 7 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: Oh, 1 wow. No problem. 2 3 PC: I’m super, I’m super good today. The weather is amazing. Can we please live in this all the time? 4 [Audience laughs]. 5 6 AJ: I’m feeling that. Totally feeling that. Uhm, so one of the reasons why I thought you two would 7 be really amazing to be apart of this, this project, is a couple of reasons, or for this particular 8 program today, uhm, is that, you know, I think your, uhm, marriage and these two are married a 9 year… 10 11 PC: and a half. 12 13 AJ: … and a half now. Uhm, I was, I was, uhm, honored to be apart of your commitment ceremony 14 and wedding. Uh, and it was an amazing opportunity, honor to be there, but, uhm, two trans 15 men marrying each other is just not a common, uhm, occurrence in our American culture. And, 16 uhm, you guys make it work so well. You are dealing with the challenges of, uhm, an interracial 17 marriage as well as a, uhm, same sex marriage, uhm, coming from this whole path of, uhm, 18 assigned female at birth. That’s a pretty fascinating story. So we want to get into that and talk a 19 little bit about some of the issues around, uhm, same sex marriage, and, and what does it mean 20 to you guys particularly after the, the Civil Rights moment last year with the supreme court, 21 uhm, ruled that same sex marriage was legal in all 50 states. Uhm, but before we get into that, I 22 just want to give you each a little bit of time to talk about yourselves and tell a little bit about 23 who you are and what your origins story, as it were. Phillipe is now a super hero if people were, 24 if anybody attended the, uhm, the Third Annual Trans Equity Summit in Minneapolis. We had a 25 display of, uhm, transgender super heroes that were done by an amazing artist but Phillipe is 26 one of those heroes. 27 28 PC: It’s so weird, uhm, to see myself as a comic book character. It’s like, “Okay, I’ll take it. That’s 29 pretty cool.” Didn’t even know that was a life goal but I definitely just checked that off. 30 [Audience laughs]. 31 32 AJ: What, what is your character? Tell people about your character. And then your match story. 33 34 PC: Sure. So my character, uhm, is the clumsy ninja. [Audience laughs]. And, uhm, because I have 35 two black belts, uhm, in two different marshal arts. And, uhm, I’m also ridiculously clumsy at the 36 same time. So as a ninja I catch stuff and then I’ll jump up the stairs. So, uh, so that’s the 37 background for that. And then the character is the politician of the, uhm, social justice league. 38 So do you know like Beast on X-Men? I’m like that guy. Sort of. [Audience laughs]. You know, I 39 like that character. So anyway, uhm, so my name is Phillipe Cunningham, and I am Mayor Betsy 40 Hodges’ Policy Aid and Advisor for Education, Youth Success, Racial Equity, and LGBT rights. 41 Uhm, and what that pretty much translates to is, so this job in the major’s office, uhm, is that I 42 have the opportunity, my full-time job is that I get to aggressively advocate for progressive 43 policies, practices, and programs in my policy areas. So, uhm, because the mayor’s vision for 44 Minneapolis is one of very much so very progressive, and so I can aggressively pursue racial 45 equity to be realized through the work. So I feel really fortunate for that. Uhm, in addition to my 46 advocacy work within the major’s office, I also am a primary coordinator for the city of 47 Minneapolis as My Brother’s Keeper. Have folks heard of My Brother’s Keeper before? So, it’s, Telling Queer History 8 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota uhm, President Obama in 2014, just to give a quick background, 1 announced an initiative 2 specifically focused on boys and young men of color, moving the dial on disparities for and 3 improving life outcomes for boys and men of color. And, uhm, in 2015 Mayor Hodges actually, 4 uhm, with Major Chris Colman and then Minnesota Council Foundations, uh, CEO, Trista Harris, 5 the three of them came together to bring it here. And quick fun story, I actually was asked to 6 speak at the launch event for My Brother’s Keeper. At the end of that event, the mayor asked 7 me to apply for my job, and now I’m the primary coordinator. So it’s like that’s pretty cool. Uh 8 [laughs]. And I’m also really fortunate because Mayor Hodges, uhm, is such a huge, tremendous 9 advocate for the trans community. Uhm, she hired me knowing exactly how I was showing up to 10 the space. Uhm, and so with that she’s giving me so much space to be able to bring all my 11 passion to the work so what that translates to is now I’m the chair of the Trans Issues Work 12 Group for the city of Minneapolis, which was started by Andrea in 2014 so thank you so much. I 13 feel so fortunate to be able to carry that torch for her. Uhm, and we’re really doing 14 groundbreaking work at a systems level for trans equity that you don’t see anywhere else in the 15 country. Uhm, and so I’m really, really grateful to be able to be apart of that work. I have, so 16 that’s what my work looks like in, in my professional life. Now, a little bit of a background about 17 myself and how I came to where I am now is that I am from a small blue collar town, uhm, rural 18 area of Illinois, small town called Streator. And, uhm, I am the child of a drycleaner and a factory 19 worker. My dad builds tractors for 38 years. So, uh, that’s kind of where I came up from. Uhm, 20 we were the only interracial family in the town for quite a long time, and I was one of the only 21 black kids in my school for a good chunk of my K through middle school years. Uhm, so needless 22 to say by the time I turned 18 I was ready to go. [Audience laughs]. So I ran right out of that 23 town, and I never looked back. Uhm, skipping forward a few years, uh, I ended up graduating 24 from DePaul University with my degrees in Chinese Studies. Uhm, my junior year while I was at 25 DePaul that was when I came out as trans and when I came out as a gay man. Uhm, and I’m very 26 grateful because, uh, that was a very supportive, educational environment at that time. So I was 27 able to very comfortably transition. People were very, very respectful so I was on campus. Uhm, 28 so I, when I graduated, uhm, I became, I got into Chicago teaching fellows, uhm, which is kind of 29 like, uh, Teach for America’s cousin. You know, it’s kind of like the same idea. Uhm, and I 30 became a special education teacher on the southside of Chicago in Chicago public schools. Uhm, 31 I specialized in, uhm, working with young folks on the autism spectrum as well as other, uhm, 32 other cognitive impairments that fall between moderate and severe categorization in special 33 education. So, uhm, I loved the work that I was doing with young folks with disabilities. I really 34 loved it. Uhm, I originally was on the path to become a lawyer, uhm, going the law route 35 because that’s how I wanted to change the world, and I realized that really actually working with 36 these young folks could be a way for me to be able to see the change that I’ve made in the 37 world. And so, uhm, but unfortunately I was working in an incredibly transphobic and hostile 38 work environment in Chicago public schools, especially on the southside. I didn’t perform my 39 masculinity the way that was prescribed and expected. Uhm, and so therefore it was an 40 extremely hostile femme phobic experience. Uhm, and so I just burned out really, really bad. 41 And when I wanted to push the reset button in 2014, that’s how I ended up in Minneapolis. Uh, I 42 wanted to come here for grad school and then the stars just aligned and within about, about a 43 year I got offered a job at the mayor’s office. So, uhm, so I’ve been very, very fortunate since I 44 got here. I love Minneapolis. 45 46 AJ: Lane, you wanna talk a little bit about how you came to be… 47 Telling Queer History 9 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota LC: 1 How I came to be? 2 3 AJ: … Lane? 4 5 LC: I’d love to. So I grew up in Colombia, Missouri. I was born and raised there, and ended up going 6 to school there. Uhm, I came out as trans initially when I was 15 or so. Uhm, and didn’t actually 7 transition until I was about 25. Uhm, and I would say that, uhm, probably the best part about my 8 transition was how blessed I was working at a place that was so supportive. Uhm, I was in social 9 work for a period of about 8 years, and, uhm, I coordinate the Missouri crisis hotline and worked 10 in a very small agency that provides services to the deaf and hard of hearing community. And, 11 uhm, it was a really small office of really wonderful people, and so I had a safe space, uhm, as I 12 was, uhm, exploring what, uhm, becoming myself would look like. Uhm, and then I ended up 13 moving to St. Louis, Missouri, and there I also continued to work in social work, uhm, working at 14 a place supporting folks with developmental disabilities. Uhm, I ran a grant that was, uhm, 15 assisting folks to transition to living more independent lives. And so that was an amazing 16 experience. And also, uhm, again, we’re working with some very incredible people who were 17 always very supportive of me so I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard and for the most 18 part my folks have been supportive too. Uhm, I’m very blessed with that. And then I met Phillipe 19 last February. So at that point I was still living in St. Louis. There’s this conference called Creating 20 Change. Has anyone heard of it? Yeah. It’s a great conference. It’s a wonderful conference. For 21 those of you who haven’t heard of it, it’s a social justice organizing conference centered around 22 LGBTQ folks put on by the LGBTQ Task Force. And last year, last February it was held in Denver, 23 Colorado, and that was when Phillipe and I met each other. We’ll probably tell that story at 24 some point. 25 26 [Someone in audience says it was two years ago]. 27 28 LC: Oh yeah, it was two years ago. [Audience laughs]. Okay, thank you. Two conferences ago. 29 Anyhow, I met Phillipe, and, uhm, he was already living in Minneapolis at the time, and, uhm, 30 just… 31 32 PC: And I said, “You’re going to end up liking Minneapolis cause I’m not going to [Audience laughs]. 33 34 LC: It was great, but Minneapolis is much better. So yeah, I actually just kind of uprooted my whole 35 life, uhm, and I knew that I had to be with Phillipe and so I moved up here, and I absolutely love 36 it here. And, actually, I transitioned out of social work after 8 years into working in IT where I 37 now work here at the university in the Office of Information and Technology. Uhm, I do support 38 for the website system on campus as well as, uhm, I get to do, uhm, support so I get to go 39 around campus to various amazing events like this actually and do the camera and audio and 40 actually to help stream that across the internet on YouTube or through other software to help 41 other people be able to access amazing events and information like this. So I’ve been fortunate 42 enough to help out with some of the stuff at the Tretter Collection and certainly with the project 43 that, uh, that, uhm, I’ve been helping Andrea with. Uhm, and I got to help her make a video, and 44 I’m sure I’ll get to go more into that but, uh, yeah, I’m super excited to be here today, to get to 45 share about our experience. 46 Telling Queer History 10 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: Wow. Well, I, I really sort of just kind of blown away by a number of things 1 about you two. You 2 guys just really amaze me. Uhm, your fashion of course is one of them. 3 4 PC: He brings all of it into the relationship. I’m very fortunate to, to be able to have, to be married to 5 my personal stylist. 6 7 LC: He makes me blush every time he says that. 8 9 AJ: So the, the gay guy with the queer eye, that’s like all real. 10 11 LC: It’s real. [Audience laughs]. 12 13 PC: It’s not really real for me so. [Audience laughs]. 14 15 AJ: No, it’s really working. But, no, you know, the careers that you both have really managed to, 16 uhm, attain for yourself at this point in life is pretty incredible, particularly when you think 17 about, you know, sort of adding trans identity into that equation. Uhm, I mean, you’re a Policy 18 Aid for the mayor, and you’re working in IT at the University of Minnesota, one of the top 19 research institutions in the country. Uhm, what do you feel like has allowed you to be able to, 20 uhm, to, I guess, land these two pretty cool career opportunities? Uhm, and do you think things 21 are changing for transgender people or is it trans masculine privilege, no shade, okay? [Audience 22 laughs]. 23 24 PC: Yeah, no shade, no shade. Let’s talk about it. Uhm, yeah, so I would say that it’s a both/and. 25 Uhm, in the sense that, uhm, both of us are out at our jobs as trans men. We’re both out as gay 26 men. Uhm, and I would definitely say that, uhm, passing privilege has definitely given me an 27 upper hand in terms of navigating my, uhm, professional career. Uhm, so, because of the fact 28 that I have passing privilege, a lot more cis folks who don’t typically interact with trans folks feel 29 more comfortable with me. And so, and so I acknowledge that that comfort is a tremendous 30 privilege, uhm, because I can say I’m trans. And they’re like, “Oh, that’s not too much.” Right? 31 Like I can relate to that person. And so, uhm, and so within that though, it gives me a lot more 32 space to challenge and push a little bit harder. And so, uhm, so, yes, I’ve been able to leverage 33 that privilege, but it’s like once I get in there I try my best to create as much space as possible 34 for other marginalized people. Uhm, and, example of that, actually right now is, uh, for the 35 Trans Issues Workgroup, Andrea has been very well involved with, we’re transitioning, uhm, 36 over to the Trans Equity Council, which will be a permanent city committee, uhm, advisory 37 committee that will now be involved in the work, and so actually what’s happening is the group 38 is transitioning from being very city oriented to being very community oriented. So really what 39 we’re doing right now is building quite a, I would say revolutionary structure within systems and 40 communities to move the dial. So I would definitely say that, uh, I got my job, uh, because I, the 41 first step was crossing paths with Andrea and the folks at the city of Minneapolis at the first 42 Trans Equity Summit. And the next step after that was that I got onto a city committee, uh, 43 based on networking after the Trans Equity Summit. So I met some folks from the city there. Uh, 44 and I met Andrea there actually. And then we go for a quick little walk, and she introduces me to 45 congressmen Ellis like it’s no big deal. And I was like, “Oh my god,” like I’m a politics nerd. And 46 she was like, “Oh yeah, you know the congressman?” like it’s no big deal. Uhm, and so, uhm, 47 then after that, uhm, I got onto a committee, which, uhm, I wasn’t an executive of anything at Telling Queer History 11 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota that time. I was just a really loud youth worker. I was working at the Wilder 1 Foundation, and I 2 was very obnoxious. I was like, “Oh, no youth voice.” You know? I was that guy. Right? Like, mm, 3 but racial equity. Right? Like I’m always that guy. And, uhm, I was fortunate because that’s what, 4 how we get selected to speak at the My Brother’s Keeper event. But, you know, and like there 5 was constantly this, uh, I was, sorry, let me take a step back. The first meeting with that 6 committee, I said, I was assigned a seat next to Mayor Hodges, and, to which I was like freaking 7 out because again I’m a politics nerd. She’s like my favorite mayor because I have a favorite 8 mayor. [Audience laughs]. And so I’m like trying to play it cool next to Mayor Hodges. And she 9 leans over during the meeting, and is like, “How did you get involved with this committee?” 10 Because I really stood out from the rest of the group. And I said, well I was recruited at the 11 Trans Equity Summit. And she was like [give affectionate punch on arm] just like a little punch 12 on the shoulder like, “Awesome.” She said, “Awesome.” Like, there was such like an unspoken, 13 like I just passively outed myself as trans. Like that’s the only reason why I would tell her where I 14 was just discovered. [Audience laughs]. Like you know? Uhm, and her eyes just lit up, was 15 welcoming. Uhm, and that was… like if the mayor is cool with that then like, honestly, I don’t 16 really care what other people have got to say so I felt more comfortable to be honest. I was so 17 much more empowered then to be open about being trans. When I was a teacher, I was very 18 scared to be out as trans, but now I, navigating these spaces very openly as trans, and I will, so 19 these. So therefore, I am able to access more spaces, and I can be very, very out. And I promised 20 myself that I would never not be out again after being in the classroom. Uhm, and so, but it’s, 21 uh, that privilege really gives me a lot of space to fight within these spaces in which we have not 22 historically had access to, to be able to bring in other folks who are from marginalized 23 communities to bring in more space. Uhm, and to shift that system, uhm, to being more 24 community oriented. So, I would say it’s both/and. 25 26 AJ: Wow. What’s your experience like around that, Lane? 27 28 LC: I would say, uhm… 29 30 AJ: I mean, yeah, yeah, actually, white, male to go along with that. 31 32 LC: Right, yeah. I am a man. I pass as my gender. And so, absolutely, that’s, uhm, that’s made it 33 easier for me as you navigate spaces. And people are just comfortable with me. Uhm, and, and 34 also as Phillipe was saying, I think that that, uhm, that makes it even more pertinent that we use 35 that space that we can take up in order to create space for other people. And so… 36 37 PC: You should talk about the, uhm, the work you did with the tier 1, like the students. 38 39 LC: Oh. 40 41 PC: The diversity work, for example. 42 43 LC: Oh, sure. Yeah, so, uhm, you know, just one of the, one of the ways that I decided to, to use my 44 privilege in, uhm, in my job right now at the Office of Information Technology is, uhm, so we 45 have the structure of the Office of Information Technology is we have a tier 1 help desk, which if 46 you call One Help at the university it’s going to be a student worker, the tier 1 help desk who 47 answers the phone. And beyond that there’s there tier 2 teams and so on who work on Telling Queer History 12 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota increasing specificity. Uhm, so, uh, I started working at the university 1 and the Office of 2 Information Technology earlier this year. And one of the first things I noticed, which I fully 3 anticipated going into the technology field was that everyone was white. And that it was 4 predominately male. And so, just being the advocate that I am, “Oh, that’s not okay.” So I went 5 in and shook things up a little. Uhm, so I started having conversations and developing 6 relationships with, uhm, other decision makers in the office, including my managers, who were 7 all very open to having this conversation about the fact that we need more people of color, this, 8 uh, you know, the, uh, demographics of this office certainly don’t reflect the demographics of 9 the university. And, uhm, we have a lot of, uhm, we have a lot of, potential here to, uhm, you 10 know, harness all of the gifts that our university has. Uhm, and everyone was, uh, was very 11 much on board with that. So, they, uhm, actually gave me a lot of leeway to help with recruiting 12 for new tier one students. And so I took some student workers with me, and we developed a 13 recruiting plan, which, honestly, wasn’t really that elaborate. It was simply just, uh, so maybe I 14 should provide some background. So up until this point I learned that the way that recruiting for 15 tier 1 happens was that they would just send out an email whenever they needed more workers 16 to all of their current workers who are white, and say, “Hey, tell your friends,” who are white 17 people friends. So we would just get, you know, it would just be, you know, self-propagating, 18 more white people. And so, really, recruiting was just centered around actually reaching out on 19 campus to other student groups and saying, “Hey, we need you. We want you. Please, you 20 know, come and bless us with your talents and gifts.” And so beginning that conversation, uhm, 21 I guess, was really easy. And the recruiting process was really quite simple too. You know, just, 22 just going to a group of people who maybe don’t look like me, and say, “Hey, I see you. You 23 matter. And certainly you have gifts to offer.” Uhm, so that was, that was a really amazing 24 experience to be able to not only, uhm, help other students, uhm, on tier 1 become more aware 25 of these needs and learn about recruiting and, uh, but also to see the fruits of these efforts 26 because, uh, it ended up being the most diverse, uhm, employee, applicant pool that the 27 university has ever seen with the tier 1. It was very, it worked very well, and then I had, and the 28 next period I actually had some more students who wanted to get involved come to me and 29 help them build a recruitment plan, and I actually just sent them off to do it on their own 30 because, you know, we have really great students here. So, yeah, the university is absolutely 31 right for it. But that’s not to say that there are, uh, barriers too, you know. I still, I go into these 32 spaces, and, and still, you know, try to shoulder, uhm, the importance of the fact that these 33 conversations need to continue to happen. And, uhm, and like you I try to take advantage of 34 those teaching opportunities, and, and develop relationships that can really have the potential 35 to create those kind of changes we want to see. 36 37 AJ: Wow, uhm, so you both have this sort of social justice, uhm, aspect of your work within these 38 sort of very traditional, uhm, occupations and careers. Uhm, so I’m curious how does social 39 justice find itself sort of enter into the rest of your life? And, and specifically around the issue of, 40 uhm, marriage and I’m not gonna say I was responsible for this marriage, I was there when you 41 guys met. [Audience laughs]. Right? 42 43 LC: There’s a picture on our fridge. 44 45 AJ: Yes, yes, yes. I was there when they first met in Denver, uhm, with the beautiful sunset over the 46 horizon. Yeah, it was quite, quite spectacular. Uhm, but talk about marriage from like a trans gay 47 perspective. How is it different? Where were you, you know, did you guys participate in the, Telling Queer History 13 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota uhm, sort of movement for same sex marriage? Were you involved in any 1 campaigns or were 2 you kind of, did you sit it out, and, you know, focus on other issues? And then, again, what is it 3 like on the other side of gay marriage being two trans identified men? 4 5 PC: Yeah, uhm, is it cool if I jump in? 6 7 LC: Sure. 8 9 PC: Uhm, there’s a lot in that. Uhm, so, let’s see. Where do I want to start? Well, I would say that, 10 you know, in terms of how social justice shows up in our relationship is, uhm, that we have a 11 really unique structure within our marriage, uhm, of support and affirmation that I feel like is 12 pretty unique and intentional because, through that social justice lens and also from our 13 journeys as trans folks. The lessons that we’ve learned, uhm, really are built into this structure in 14 our relationship and our marriage, that, uhm, it’s what’s going to make it sustainable. Uhm, and 15 so. And then also, uhm, I personally was not really ever involved in marriage equality, uhm, 16 work. Uhm, I at that time was, uh, much more of a, an activist in education. Like that’s typically 17 where my work was cause I was in classroom at the time, and I was working with young folks 18 with disabilities, young folks of color with disabilities. So, uh, so that’s really where my work was 19 at the time, uhm, because I honestly felt like when it came to impact that working with those 20 kids was more of an impact in their lives than marriage equality, if that makes sense. So, uh, I 21 was inspired more about getting, uhm, more specific rather than issue focused. Uhm, we 22 actually got married two weeks to the day after the announcement. And, uh, you know, I am so 23 incredibly grateful for all of the work that Senator Scott Dibble did and leading a lot of that 24 work, uhm, because we get to ream the benefits of it, 100%. In terms of, uhm, I think that apart 25 of being on this side of marriage, you know, being married, being a trans couple, one thing that 26 actually really emerged out of it that was particularly special was that, uhm, our, so learning like 27 I love him and his transness. And that in turn, actually, like first of all, falling in love with him 28 made me realize how much of my own internalized, uh, transphobia that I was carrying because 29 the love that I have for him and his transness made me suddenly realize like how I was viewing 30 my own and came to love my own even more. And, uhm, when we talked about that before, he 31 also reflected that back that, uhm, being with another trans person has really actually been so 32 incredibly liberating, uhm, in terms of loving my own, our own transness. Uhm, so and, and 33 there are special areas of like support and validation and affirmation that really it’s a nuance of 34 the trans experience. And so, uhm, you know, on, on the surface, you know, we are, when we 35 walk out into the world, we are viewed as a cisgender, gay, male couple. Like that’s how we are 36 viewed. However, there are so much more under the surface, you know. Uhm, because of the 37 fact that we are a queer trans couple. So there’s just so much more happening in there. 38 39 AJ: Wow, it’s interesting. You brought up, and I do want to hear from you, Lane, about this so 40 please don’t lose your train of thought, but, uhm, you brought this, this issue up about, sort of 41 the things that, you know, trans, a transgender couple may be able to recognize and/or support 42 in each other in a way that, uhm, cisgender people just don’t have a full concept of. And it made 43 me think about, you know, being black in an interracial couple. And there are some things no 44 matter how big of an ally you are, you know, you just can’t fully understand as a white person 45 what is happening, uhm, you know, people at the end of the day when you go home and you 46 talk about your experiences of the day, uhm, you know, in an interracial couple, people may be Telling Queer History 14 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota able to empathize but they don’t necessarily fully understand. But that is 1 eliminated around the 2 trans issue, right? Like… 3 4 PC: No. Uhm, I, so, I have lots to say about the interracial aspect, if that’s cool for me to say. 5 6 AJ: [Laughs]. 7 8 PC: Uhm, so, so January 20, when was that 2015 when we were in Denver? 9 10 AJ: Yeah. 11 12 PC: So, uh, so yeah, so in January of 2015, I called my parents, and I announce to them that I was 13 never going to date a white guy again, ever, and then I met Lane like 3 weeks later. Okay, so the 14 universe likes to play games like that. Uhm, but, so the reason why I said that I was never going 15 to date a white guy again was because I was like I can’t be with someone who can never, who 16 would deny my experience. Like who, there are so many gay men, white gay men who I 17 encountered who, um, would say things like, “Race doesn’t exist in my world, and I would prefer 18 to keep it that way.” Or, uhm, “Well, it’s not that different from being gay.” Right? Like so 19 constantly dismissing my experience. And so I was like not about that life, particularly because 20 when we transition. Or I should say, from the time that I transitioned from a black woman, I had 21 light skin privilege, I had beauty privilege as a woman. I’ll fully admit that now. And then 22 transitioning into being a black man at 23 all the sudden I woke up, and I was public enemy #1. I 23 wasn’t ready. And to so then have people be like, “Oh, now, our experiences are exactly the 24 same. I definitely understand where you’re coming from.” Or, “No, that’s not really. That’s not 25 really what’s happening. You’re making it up.” And so I was like, “Oh, girl, neva again. Mhm. 26 That’s too much emotional energy.” I could not go home every day and not have somebody who 27 can hold that, right? So I’m at Creating Change. I just met Lane, and Lane and I were friends first 28 for a few months before we started dating. And, uhm, we were at a vigil for Jessie Hernandez, 29 who, uhm, for the folks who don’t know, uhm, queer, young, Latinx person who was shot by the 30 Denver police, uh, shot and killed by the Denver police. So we had a vigil for them, and, uhm, 31 there was at one point, somebody was facilitating and said turn to the person next to you and 32 talk about what’s coming up for you right now. And so I turned to Lane cause he was the person 33 next to me. And at first I was like, “Yay, I’m talking to this babe. Yes!” Uhm, so step one. And 34 then like, so, I was, we were in this very social justice warrior oriented space right at Creating 35 Change. So I was feeling really audacious as a person of color about to tell a white person what 36 was coming up for me. Uhm, and, uhm, so I shared what was coming up for me very 37 authentically. And his response, like, so he was like, “Hm, I can hear that.” I can’t ever fully 38 capture the feeling that I had. It was the first time I felt held entirely in my experience by a white 39 person. Uhm, and like, uhm, not only… it was the first time that I felt true empathy to the 40 honest from a person, from a white person when I talk about my experience. Uhm, and so that 41 really, like I very clearly remember that, that interaction. Uhm, and the thing is that I can come 42 home every single day, and I can talk about how terrible it is to constantly be navigating white 43 supremacy in this system that I have chosen to step into. I call myself an activist in a suit, uhm, 44 you know, I chose to navigate these space, but it’s so emotionally draining. I’m sure as you 45 know. It’s been 12 years in city hall. Uhm, but I’m able to come home every single day to talk 46 about how white folks are interacting with me, talking about how, uhm, the experiences that I 47 have, and I’m 100% held. And, uhm, he processes with me and then, honestly, he challenges me Telling Queer History 15 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota and provides me with perspective that’s so helpful like in my processing process. 1 So, uhm, as a 2 person of color and black man so, uhm, I’m the product of an interracial relationship, uhm, 3 interracial marriage, and I can say that my mom cannot hold my dad, like his experience. She 4 can’t. Uhm, she was a white privileged denier, uhm, up until I was probably like 23 or 24 when 5 all of a sudden I was a black man. She was like, “Oh, god the cops.” Like that was the first time, 6 like now that she had a black son, now she gets that race is a real thing. Uhm, and so, so I know 7 what that looks like, and I know the frequency in which interracial relationships can kind of have 8 that icky dynamic. But one of the true blessings is that I believe that his experience as a trans 9 person, uhm, that experience of reflection and growing that really helped prepare him to hold 10 me in ways, uhm, that were very unexpected, to be honest. I swore I was like never again. And 11 then I was like actually. [Audience laughs]. 12 13 AJ: Wow, what’s your thoughts around this whole marriage and queer identity and trans identity 14 and how that, uhm, how that all plays out for you, Lane? 15 16 LC: Yeah, uhm, well first of all, you know, there, there are multiple dimensions to how I feel about 17 marriage, marriage equality. Uhm, primarily as it relates to just our relationship, I am so 18 incredibly grateful to have been able to marry the love of my life and be able to, uhm, proclaim 19 my love that way. And also, we’ll be able to get some benefits and stuff. [Lane and audience 20 laughs]. You know? What a privilege that is to have the ability to do that, and, uhm, to have the 21 privilege to have you at our wedding too. 22 23 PC: There were like 4 people there just to let you know how small it was. It was like… 24 25 LC: Our wedding party was entirely trans people too. It was pretty cool. 26 27 AJ: Yeah. 28 29 LC: As for our relationship, I would really, uhm, echo kind of that, uh, that multidimensionality that 30 you described in, in the way that, as a trans person in my experience in being trans has required 31 a lot of self reflection in order to figure out who I am, what feels good to me, uhm, what feels 32 healthy to me. And in doing so, uhm, that has allowed me to understand that other people have, 33 uhm, a different perspective, and so that, that’s really, uhm, a great jumping off point, I think, in 34 our relationship in terms of how we provide support to one another is, uhm, you know, just 35 being able to bring the sense of, you know, we’re both existing in this relationship and we’re 36 both bringing things to it, and, uhm, to really make time to understand each other better. Uhm, 37 and certainly to make up for all the time when we thought that maybe people didn’t understand 38 us and, and how that’s looked in our lives individually. Uhm, as for the, you know, being a queer 39 couple, uhm, I feel so fortunate to be able to share this experience with you and how we can, 40 uhm, you know, have this, this, uh, this similar sense of identity but also have these different 41 parts of ourself that we are bringing to our relationship which makes it that much richer. Uhm, 42 and having that place of comfort and just sort of understanding the underlying fact that we’re 43 trans and how, how much that can, uhm, has, did take my experience and certainly my 44 perception of myself and, uhm, yeah. Did I cover everything? 45 46 AJ: Yeah, I mean, it’s your own, you know, thoughts. 47 Telling Queer History 16 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 LC: Yeah. 2 3 AJ: You know, I’m just thinking it’s remarkable, uhm, around two trans queer gay identified persons 4 getting married. When, when I came out 25 years ago, I mean, it was totally taboo to, uhm, 5 think about same sex relationships, uhm, you know, certainly not publicly and not getting 6 married. Uhm, and, you know, it’s just making me think how things have changed over time and 7 how you two are really sort of breaking ground in terms of human relationships and really 8 opening up space. It is really quite revolutionary. So I just want to acknowledge that and maybe 9 we should all acknowledge that cause it is a beautiful thing. [Audience claps]. So, you know, I 10 talked about the oral history project and we’re, uhm, right at interview 100. 11 12 PC: That’s awesome. 13 14 AJ: And you, you guys, both participated in that. Can you talk a little bit about what it was like to 15 participate and to share, uhm, your stories, uhm, in that project and what do you think that 16 means to a community, to, uhm, individuals maybe, uhm, struggling with their gender identity. 17 Uhm, what does it mean to you to participate in that way in the oral history project? Why don’t 18 you start Lane? 19 20 LC: Wow, uhm, well, I remember the day of my interview. It was when you were just picking up 21 things off the ground, and you had a few scheduled and you had a goal to get an interview in 22 that day. 23 24 AJ: Right. 25 26 LC: And I came to visit you, I think, to, uh, to do some work. 27 28 AJ: Mhm. 29 30 LC: And, uh, uh, I remember getting to your office and you were like, “Oh man, my, my interview is 31 canceled for today. Do you wanna tell your story?” [Audience laughs]. And at that point, uh, I 32 hadn’t actually thought about participating, but in that, in that moment I, I made a decision 33 because, uhm, you know, beyond the nervousness that I felt in that moment and just kind of not 34 having prepared, it was such an amazing opportunity, uhm, to be able to be apart of something 35 bigger. Uhm, and, uhm, it was, it felt very vulnerable telling, telling my story. And, uhm, a lot of 36 the questions that you ask, I think, sort of the difference in the way that, that you have 37 structured this is just, is the, the fact that, that you understand ways to be respectful of 38 transgender people as you’re asking questions and as you’re asking them to share their 39 experiences and, uhm, that allows for this sort of richer, uhm, story to feel safe coming out and 40 so I, uhm, I really thank you for that. Uhm, I, I am, this project is so important to me personally 41 because, uh, you know, back when I was 15, uhm, I’m almost 30 now, uhm, I didn’t have any 42 examples of trans people to look up to. In fact, the first, uhm, exposure I had to what it means 43 to be trans is, uhm, when I was high school I was involved in the, uhm, in the gay straight 44 alliance at my high school. And, uh, it was an after school program. We, we all went and met in a 45 classroom and were going to be watching a movie. And that movie happened to be Boys Don’t 46 Cry. Did everyone see it? It’s a horrific story. Uhm, Brandon Teena. Uhm, so this movie, uhm, 47 follows the story of Brandon Teena who was, uhm, a trans man that was ultimately murdered. Telling Queer History 17 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota And, so, uhm, I’m sitting there in GSA and watching that movie, and, uh, and 1 I’m seeing, “Oh my 2 god. That’s me. Oh my god. That’s me.” You know, so this was the first exposure that I had to, to 3 what it means to be trans. And so, uhm, the sweetness, uhm, for me in this project is just 4 knowing that, uhm, that, you know, future folks and people even now who are getting these 5 opportunities to learn about the project and connect with each other, this is a way that will help 6 people not feel so along. Uhm, it’s a way to really connect our community and, and certainly to, 7 you know, add to this beautiful tapestry, each individual story, uhm, and the richness that that 8 brings and being able to tell this collective story to this collection so. 9 10 AJ: Wow. Any thoughts, Phillipe? 11 12 PC: Yeah, I mean, I would say that being apart of this has been such a huge, huge honor. Uhm, I 13 would say that with this project essentially as we are becoming a more visible community, uhm, 14 it’s, this is like the perfect time to take control of the narrative, right? Like as we become more 15 visible we could go two different directions. We can either go really aggressively towards the 16 single narrative or we can be very intentional and insistent on the rich tapestry of what our 17 community, who is our community, what do we bring to the table, right? Uhm, and I’m so 18 honored to be apart of that and tell my story, uh, to be able to add to the overall, uhm, narrative 19 that, that changing of the narrative. Uhm, I think it’s also really cool like to think about it being 20 replayed in two hundred years. 21 22 AJ: [Laughs]. 23 24 PC: You know? Like how much in libraries are from hundreds of years ago, right? 25 26 AJ: This is true. 27 28 PC: And so, uhm, who knows, in two hundred years it’s all tech based so like, you know, it’s, I just 29 like to think about it being hundreds of years from now in this pivotal time when trans people 30 started to exist in mainstream consciousness. 31 32 AJ: Mhm. 33 34 PC: Uhm, and how we as a community rose up from being invisible to being visible very powerfully. 35 And so I’m very excited to be apart of this. 36 37 AJ: You know, one of the things that I’ve noticed in talking to, uhm, just such a wide variety of 38 people doing this project is the erosion, if you will, of the gender binary. Uhm, and you both are, 39 I’m pretty sure still in the millennial, uh, [laughs] age range. And what are your thoughts about 40 gender construction as it is today, and how do you see it changing? 41 42 LC: Well, I’ll just start off and just say that gender is complex and, and is something, uhm, that can 43 also be used as a tool. Uhm, and I think that it’s so, uhm, beautiful that we are coming to the 44 realization that, uhm, that, that this diversity in gender expression is actually a, a beautiful 45 human experience. And, uhm, being able to appreciate that even more as people feel more 46 comfortable to express themselves as, uhm, as, uhm, people sharing their stories. And I think 47 that that’s also an amazing component to the Trans Oral History Project is that it really captures Telling Queer History 18 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota that, uhm, that breadth in gender expression and that that ultimately has 1 so much power to 2 change the very foundation of our culture, uhm, and the ways that gender is so embedded in 3 our society, and certainly expectations of people so. 4 5 PC: I am, so in my position I had the opportunity to navigate a lot of youth oriented spaces, uh, 6 cause that’s my primary policy area for the mayor is, uhm, education and youth success. So, 7 uhm, I would say that in navigating these spaces, I am constantly getting reenergized by the 8 dissolving of the gender binary with younger folks. Uhm, and the reason why, you know, I finally 9 have really fallen into my gender identity. I finally, I mean, you know, for those of us who are 10 kind of like, “Screw the binary. I’m gonna play however I feel like it.” It’s kind of like you go back 11 and forth figuring it out sometimes. I’ll speak for myself. I did. I went back and forth figuring it 12 out. Uhm, and I honestly didn’t fully realize my gender until I was with Lane. Uhm, because I had 13 such a prescriptive idea, and I felt so limited. It’s like, you know, I have to these sorts of things. 14 You know, I felt obligated to now perform gender in other ways. I was performing gender 15 before, and now I was like, I felt like I was doing it in a different way now on this side of gender, 16 uhm, the gender binary. And so, uhm, I, but, I had the really amazing opportunity to be able to 17 let go of those notions, let go of those stories because of the fact that I was with someone who 18 we show up exactly as is. We have our strengths. We have our weaknesses. We have our 19 personalities. And the way that we’re able to show up as authentic individuals, it was like, “Oh, 20 there’s my gender identity.” [Laughs]. Like this. I don’t, I don’t know how to name it but like this 21 is who I am, and so I just think about younger people like as we move forward, dissolving as we 22 continue to dissolve these really oppressive structures, like social constructs that people feel 23 this level of relief in living out gender. 24 25 AJ: And I think it’s a really important thing for you guys as an audience to realize that we all have a 26 gender so this is not a transgender issue or a, uhm, a thing that’s happening to transgender 27 people. Like it is impacting how gender is being seen, recognized, and performed throughout 28 culture. Uhm, and it’s pretty powerful, and it’s happening pretty rapidly as well. Uhm, wow, this 29 has been, uh, a fascinating conversation but I want to make sure that, that the audience gets an 30 opportunity to engage so that’s it’s not just a didactic kind of thing. Uh, so I wanna open it up to 31 questions and comments and thoughts. [Audience laughs]. AJ is really, really ready. 32 33 [AJ] All of y’all are just so adorable. All of you are adorable. 34 35 AJ: And I just wanna say that AJ has on like three different pronouns… 36 37 [AJ]: [Laughs]. 38 39 AJ: … which is like the perfect person to ask the first question after those comments, right? He, him, 40 they, yeah. That’s awesome. 41 42 [AJ]: And it actually works cause my question is about like binary stuff and non-binary. Uhm, so, uhm, 43 you talked about like gender like going back and fourth, kinda figuring it out. Uhm, but, like 44 correct me if I’m wrong, like, you, but I suppose both of you, uhm, still identify mostly as like 45 binary trans men for the most part. 46 47 PC: Mhm. Telling Queer History 19 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 [AJ]: And I was wondering like how, if you see binary privilege come up and in what ways do you see 3 that come up? Uhm, and even, I call it gender privilege because I’m agender. So do you, do you 4 see any privilege in being, you know, a binary gender and being any gender and then people 5 with a lack of gender. 6 7 PC: Yes, so, uhm, I would absolutely say that, uhm, that there are… I mean, I will say privilege, uhm, 8 but it’s complicated, but yes. Uhm, in terms of conversation around gender it is still very binary 9 and a lot of trans folks still, not a lot, but, you know, there’s nothing wrong with those of us who 10 do identify, uhm, on the binary, with the binary, I guess you could say. I mean, I don’t identify 11 with it. I wish it was smashed, and we could all just live our lives in our comfortable selves, but, 12 uhm, but I would say that one of the issues, and I know that I’m not saying anything new, it’s 13 just that gender non-conforming folks are just not yet fully included in the conversation, and I 14 wouldn’t necessarily say that the privilege that is afforded to us isn’t, I mean it’s still like that 15 binary sort of privilege. It’s still passing privilege. Uhm, so, uh, cause with that, uhm, because 16 both of us do identity as men. You know, uhm, and so, and then like we go out into the world 17 and are seen as and respected as such. And so there’s inherently privilege in that. Uhm, and so 18 it’s much easier for me to walk into spaces and to be able to use he/him pronouns that for a lot 19 of folks who are gender non-conforming to walk in and say I wanna use, like please use 20 they/them with me, right? So like that inherently is a privilege and definitely, I definitely own 21 that. 22 23 LC: No, I completely agree with what you said. 24 25 PC: Did that answer your question? 26 27 [AJ]: Yeah. 28 29 AJ: Any other folks that have thoughts coming to you? 30 31 [Audience]: 32 33 I was wondering if you could, uhm, talk a little bit more about your experience and journey like 34 navigating black masculinity and how you’ve seen that change over time or if you’ve seen it 35 change and especially with sort of your policy work? 36 37 PC: Yeah. 38 39 AJ: Do black lives matter, Phillipe? 40 41 PC: Oh my god. Yes, black lives matter. Black trans lives matter. Black women matter. Yes. Uhm, 42 yeah, I, so, I… I would say that waking up at 23 in some way, I mean, my testosterone kicked in 43 pretty quick for me. So I would say that from the time that I, when I came out it was like very 44 sudden. People didn’t know I was a high femme. I was mostly straight at the time. So people 45 were like, “Wait, what?” It just came really quick, and then I started to pass I would say about 46 80% of the time within like 4 months of starting testosterone. So I went from like high femme to 47 black man very fast that I was not emotionally prepared for it. Uhm, I really, like, uhm, because Telling Queer History 20 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota all of a sudden now… So as a black woman I experienced racism through this really 1 gross sexism, 2 misogynistic lens, right? Like there was inherently like a sexual violence lens to the experience 3 that I had as a black woman. As a black man there was just aggression, un, un, like, untethered 4 aggression, especially when I was living in Chicago. It was like if I approached like a white man, 5 like if my car, literally my car broke down, and this dude was like ready to fight me when I was 6 walking up to him. And I’m like, “Oh.” Like I just, like I had never had that before, especially as a 7 pretty light skinned woman, right? Like I could walk up to somebody and ask for help and now 8 all of a sudden people were being extremely aggressive towards me assuming that I was a 9 threat. Uhm, and people were cutting me in line. People were bumping me off the sidewalk. 10 Uhm, people were saying these ludicrous things to me, like I would be outside of the club trying 11 to make friends at a gay bar, trying to make friends, and, uhm, they’d be like, “I’m not into black 12 guys,” before I even finished like, it’s like, “Dude. What are you talking about?” Like, I was just 13 saying [laughs] hi. There was, uhm, constant reminder of my blackness once I transitioned. Uhm, 14 and it made me so angry. Like, you know, they talk about when you sift the poison you build a 15 tolerance for it so that’s what a lot of, a lot of black men will explain about their experience of 16 racism, uhm, cause they were raised with it. It’s like you’re constantly, you’re conditioned to be 17 able to cope with it, and I was not, I was not prepared for it. And so, uhm, I would say that 18 actually, like in terms of my trans experience, uhm, that is hands down the hardest part is 19 learning how to live with, like it’s a lifelong process of learning how to cope with the anger that 20 goes along with navigating the world in this, in this body and the perceptions in which people 21 see me. So, uhm, and, and it’s, and honestly, in the end it ultimately caused me a lot of my 22 blackness so much deeper in a way that I didn’t expect going into my transition. Uhm, because 23 of the fact that, uhm, I never was really forced in a lot of ways to truly examine why am I black. 24 Like I didn’t, like I was like, “Okay, I’m fine, I’m a black woman. That’s fine.” I was just able to 25 really navigate, skirt around… I love my blackness but it… once I transitioned and then the level 26 of aggression went up so much that I had to cope. So then, I turned within my blackness and 27 showed, and found a deep love that I wasn’t expecting. So that has been an integral part of my 28 transition is, uhm, a process of becoming a black man. Uhm, and right now it’s pretty damn hard 29 in our country. Uhm, so. 30 31 AJ: Uhm, Eliot, you wanna go? 32 33 [Eliot]: Yeah, uhm, my question is for everyone but I wanna know specifically about, uhm, your 34 experience, Andrea, of doing interviews in and outside of the Twin Cities. Uhm, and I’m also 35 interested in your reflection on kind of rural America. Uhm, I live in rural Minnesota, and I’m 36 wondering if there’s any hope for kind of rural spaces, uhm, uhm, especially considering that, 37 you know, it’s a place where our food is grown. Uhm, and, uh, there are lots of conversations 38 over kind of indigenous rights. Uhm, and I’m wondering how that, uh, complicates the 39 conversation because, you know, one of the things that I realize is, uhm, there is like a, like an 40 urban privilege that goes underrecognized. Uhm, and it’s just something that I’m thinking about. 41 Uhm, you know, could you talk about this migration outside and, you know, you’ve also been 42 kinda of seen in those spaces so I’m kind of just wondering, you know, is there hope for kind of 43 rural America, and if so what does that hope look like? And, uhm, yeah. How might we be able 44 to kind of support across these geographic kind of spaces? 45 46 AJ: Well, I just wanna start, uhm, wow, that’s a pretty complex question. Uhm, but, you know, 47 conducting the interviews, particularly, uhm, outside of the Twin Cities, uhm, you know, I’ve Telling Queer History 21 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota been really fortunate to be invited into communities, uhm, to, to talk about 1 the project, to talk 2 about my work, to talk about, uhm, trans identity, and sort of that intersections around race and 3 gender and culture. Uhm, and then within that context I am fortunate to set up interviews with 4 people in those communities’. Uhm, primarily it’s been in, in larger cities so probably a lot of 5 that urban privilege that you talked about, uhm, you know, I’ve interviewed people in 6 Washington D.C. and New York City, uhm, in Seattle, uhm, Chicago, places where there are more 7 resources for trans identified people. And so not as much as the isolation that, uhm, that trans 8 identified people experience in smaller communities. Uhm, I am just this upcoming weekend 9 going to be traveling to, uhm, Fargo, North Dakota to conduct some interviews and then 10 subsequently a couple weeks later will be going to Duluth and, and doing some, uhm, 11 interviewing up there. Uhm, and, you know, I find myself thinking about what does it mean for a 12 black trans woman to come into these spaces… You know, because for people living there, 13 they’re sort of created some level of coping, you’ve used that term a couple of times today, 14 uhm, on how to cope in those small communities, and, uhm, you know, I have interviewed 15 people in Lacrosse, Wisconsin and St. Joseph, Minnesota, uhm, Ramsey, Minnesota, uhm, and 16 people talk about how, you know, how close the communities are, and so, uhm, seemingly they 17 are able to cope with me coming in, sort of is disruptive in, in some ways. And, and a little, uhm, 18 I mean, quite freighting for my own safety in terms of just where, you know, where there is 19 really heightened level sense of, uhm, sort of blatant racism and, uhm, which has been leading 20 to physical violence and, uhm, like, just horrific police interactions and all these kind of things. 21 And so, uhm, I’ve been maybe, I don’t know, unwanted. So I’m not quite sure if that’s true, but 22 I’m really kind of concerned around my own, uhm, safety. But not only that but how, how does a 23 black woman coming into these spaces and interviewing primarily white people like how does 24 that impact the responses that I’m getting? How does that, uhm, cause here in, in the cities in 25 my own sort of comfortable urban environment, like Lane mentioned I’m able to be a little 26 more, uhm, I guess, able to hold space for people but when I go outside the community, you 27 know, can people hold space for me, like those are the questions that I’m kind of dealing with 28 and thinking about. Uhm, just the actual physical traveling and interviewing people around the 29 country, it’s really, I mean, there is no single narrative. There absolutely is no single narrative, 30 right? But there are so many similarities no matter where I go, who I talk to, uhm, there, there 31 are just these very sort of similar, uhm, challenges that people face within, uhm, you know, 32 trying to get ID changed, accessing health care, uhm, interacting in school and institutions. Uhm, 33 it’s very, very similar. And even the ways that people come to their gender, uhm, recognition, if 34 you will, are very similarly told stories. Uhm, one of the questions that I always start with, you 35 know, go back to your earliest memory and, uhm, and then I preface that by saying, you know, 36 don’t rack your brain to come up with a gender memory. Like just whatever you remember. And 37 almost every single person, the memory is always around gender. It’s really interesting. Yeah. 38 It’s really, really quite interesting. Uhm, so those are some of the insights around that. And I 39 think talked about the whole geographic piece a little bit on the first end so. 40 41 PC: Yeah, so I’m from the cornfields of Illinois. Uhm, and, uhm, I left in 2005. And, uhm, I, I was on 42 the first wave of cyberbullying with AIM. Anybody remember AIM? Before MySpace, all that 43 stuff. Yeah, so, uhm, I was on the first wave of that, and I was really severely tortured for most 44 of my childhood and teen years both for being, uhm, a little too tomboyish and then, uh, so 45 everybody sort of made fun of me for that and then also for being black. Uhm, so I left with a 46 very bad taste in my mouth where my whole hometown was like, “Oh, well I’m done with these 47 people.” But, of course, Facebook now exists so now we are all connected, and they see my life Telling Queer History 22 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota day in and day out, these people that I went to high school with and people 1 from my hometown. 2 When I first came out as trans, of course, the Facebook world went a buzz. Like I could see 3 people from my hometown mocking me and saying things on Facebook about me. And what 4 was interesting, though was that I also started to see people from my hometown defending me 5 on Facebook. Uhm, like I didn’t have to say anything. People who I was barely acquainted with 6 in high school were like, “WTF, that’s not okay. Like get out of here with that.” Uhm, and so, 7 uhm, when I went back for the first time people were kind of uncomfortable. People were really 8 not using pronouns, right pronouns, using wrong name, but some people were catching 9 themselves and some people were trying to fix it, uhm, fix themselves. Uhm, over the process of 10 about a couple of years, the fact that they saw my life, day in, day out, my trials, my tribulations, 11 what my jobs were, me graduating from college, I humanized trans people for them. That’s my 12 theory, because, you know, everybody pretty much scrolls on Facebook, you know, when 13 they’re bored at this point, you know? And so, uh, so they just got to see my story, and it really 14 humanized me. And then as a result, uhm, one of my biggest bullies, actually, uhm, from my 15 hometown, when I went back one time for the holidays, uh, we were out, there, you know, I’m 16 from a really small town, so it’s like pretty much like every, every Thanksgiving and/or Christmas 17 is a high school reunion of like 25 classes, uh, cause everybody comes back, uhm, and so what 18 are you going to do? So everybody goes to the bar. So we go and, uhm, this bully that I went to 19 school with, he just was like, “Come here, man, look at these pictures.” He was showing me 20 pictures of his kids, videos of them like doing kid stuff, like slobbering. [Audience laughs]. Like 21 he’s so proud of his kid. And like the, and then he like, “Let me buy you a beer.” Like, you know, 22 he’s like patting me on the back and treating me like one of the guys. And I really in that 23 moment was like, “How did this even happen?” You know, like, uhm, so that gives me a lot of 24 hope cause I’m from middle America. Uhm, and the fact that, uhm, now people from my 25 hometown are like putting up stuff about Black Lives Matter, and I’m like, “What? Like from 26 Streator?” Like you got up Black Lives Matter stuff. I see them sharing trans stuff. And I’m like, 27 so they’re really blowing my mind. You know what I mean? So I would say that there is hope. 28 Uhm, and, uhm, it, the biggest barrier, I think it’s for like really any marginalized group between 29 if you compare rural and urban is, uhm, like lack of exposure. And so when we have lack of 30 exposure to marginalized groups, the more abstract they become and the more the single 31 narrative comes up and the more dehumanized those marginalized groups become. So, uhm, 32 my folks seeing my story day in day out that humanized trans people for them. I also very clearly 33 spoke about being a black man and the experience of that. Thank you [handed bottle of water]. 34 Uhm, and that also shifted a lot of people’s perspective. So, uhm, if I can give any sort of 35 practical perspective I would say it’s about the process of humanizing. Uhm, that could really 36 help with the dial because I believe that the greatest contributor to oppression is just sheer 37 ignorance. 38 39 AJ: Lane, did you want to comment on that? 40 41 LC: No, I don’t think that was my question. 42 43 AJ: Angela? I think my mic went dead but… did you still have a question? 44 45 [Angela]: 46 Telling Queer History 23 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota I do still have a question. Yes. Thank you all so much for being here. It’s just a 1 pleasure to get to 2 listen to all of your perspectives and, uhm, to hear about this project. I, uhm, I don’t know, a 3 couple of weeks ago I saw, uhm, this person, M Addams speak from Wisconsin. Uhm, they’re 4 really brilliant. They were talking about in the LGBTQ movement, uhm, it’s really our 5 responsibility to work for like gender liberation for everybody, uhm, and that there’s still a lot of 6 blind spots about where our work is, uhm, and I thought like were kind of like schooling the 7 crowd, that’s like traditionally like the white male led activist crowd about when, uhm, black 8 men are being profiled for their masculinity, that’s actually, that’s actually our business. Uhm, I 9 thought that was a liberating thought, and I guess on the same subject of like, uhm, searching 10 for gender liberation for everybody in our community, our larger, community, uhm, uhm, how 11 do we like keep addressing patriarchy and sexism and especially like some of our, our, uhm, 12 trans sisters like live the most dangerous intersections of that. How do we, how do we break it 13 all apart and yet still address the reality of gender that will, that in society we’re sort of trapped 14 in? 15 16 AJ: Wow, uhm, so for me that looks like centering, uhm, women of color feminism in our analysis. 17 So, you know, black women feminism is really the model. I think that, we have, which is all 18 around intersections and, and recognizing where all of our, uhm, where all of our live collide. So 19 the person that you mentioned… Adam Inn? 20 21 [Angela]: 22 23 M Addams. 24 25 AJ: M Addams. 26 27 [Angela]: 28 29 Yeah. 30 31 AJ: Uhm, you know, that, that whole analysis extends to the queer community, right? People are 32 mostly discriminated against or harassed or, uhm, meet with violence not because of who they 33 sleep with but because of the way they present in public spaces. And if they’re presentation is, 34 uhm, transgressing whatever gender norms are established for that community, then they face 35 discrimination, harassment, violence, uhm, sexism, so, uhm, masculine presenting women, you 36 know, tend to face more harassment than feminine women. And effeminate men face more 37 harassment than straight appearing couples. Uhm, so I, I absolutely think it’s all of our business 38 to really address these, uhm, gender issues. And I think, you know, the model, which is really 39 challenging to do it appears, to do it from a black feminist womanist approach, which is what, 40 you know, Angela Davis talks about, which is, uhm, bell hooks talks about, uhm, all of these 41 models that are trans inclusive, uhm, inclusive of issues around reproductive rights, uhm, and if 42 we can center that and really create, uhm, equity for all women, which starts with black trans 43 women and all the way up then, you know, I think we get at… I mean, those systems are 44 designed to try and break down patriarchy and, uhm, religious subjugation, which I think those 45 two think go hand in hand. Patriarchy upholds religion and religion upholds male patriarchy. 46 And, you know, we gotta get at that. And so we can’t not have sexism as a goal for dismantling 47 and to expect to achieve full human equality. Telling Queer History 24 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 LC: So for me, uhm, it’s a very personal process of just continually challenging my own biases and 3 the things that I’m bringing things to the table. The ways that, uhm, that I may be contributing 4 to patriarchy and oppression of other people. Uhm, it’s, it’s really just about being aware of the 5 space that I’m taking up. Who else is in the room, who isn’t in the room, who should be in the 6 room, and how can I get them there in the room with me? Uhm, and yeah, I think for me it’s just 7 continually challenging myself, and, uhm, making sure that I’m not contributing to, uhm, to the 8 outcome that, that I, that I’m constantly trying to push back. 9 10 PC: Uhm, due to the work that I do, I tend to be very, uhm, pragmatic in terms of the approach. And, 11 uhm, the analysis of things like policies, practices, and programs. And the, in my opinion, the key 12 lever to really begin to really center the, uhm, challenging the patriarchy, really lives in 13 dismantling the negative consequences of masculinity. So, uhm, toxic masculinity is just all 14 throughout decision making on all levels in all institutions, and in behaviors that people bring 15 into those spaces. Uhm, and so, I think if we center around like pulling that string of how toxic 16 masculinity has just wound itself so tightly around the institutions and systems that shape our 17 everyday lives, uhm, that that’s really a lever that we can pull. And it’s also identifiable, uhm, 18 like when that manifests. Uhm, for a lot of folks, uhm, you know, folks who aren’t like in the 19 work or like in the movements speak the language when we talk about like, you know, break the 20 patriarchy. They’re like, “Alright, go burn your bras and come back to work, please,” right? Like, 21 uhm, but when we talk about masculinity and the toxicity of how it shows up I feel like it’s a 22 little bit more concrete for people to be able to understand. So that’s some of the language that 23 I use in order to make sure that we are still centering that part of the conversation. 24 25 AJ: You know, uhm, Lisa posted an article earlier today or maybe last night about, uhm, you know, 26 Donald Trump may signal the end of the boys network. And, and I do think that there’s some 27 truth to that in some ways. I mean, I think toxic masculinity just took like a big blow, uh, this 28 past weekend. One can only hope, right? Uhm, that of these people who are denouncing and, 29 uhm, stating how abhorrent they see, uhm, you know, Trump’s comments about, uhm, his 30 actions and willingness to just, uhm, visibly abuse women without consent like if people are 31 really taking that serious that means that we as a whole culture and society are gonna do things, 32 create policies, create procedures, create programs cause I think some of the males in our 33 culture need to be deprogramed around some of the, uhm, I think you’re calling it toxic 34 masculinity tendencies, uhm, out of our culture. So, uhm, yeah. I just kind of wanted to 35 comment on that because I think that is like one of the biggest symbols. You know, we’ve seen 36 so many people talking at such a high level in our cultural stratosphere that potentially some 37 change can come. It’s, it’s deeply, I mean, implicit bias is not just about race, right? Implicit bias 38 is also around, uhm, gender and, uhm, sex, and sexism and it plays out as equally. That’s why 39 anybody who calls themselves a feminist should be an anti-racist person because those two 40 things are stimming from the exact same space, and we’re never going to eliminate one without 41 the other. 42 43 PC: And if you try to do one without the other, then you’re just seeking privilege and not liberation. 44 45 AJ: So if there are more comments or questions, I know that, uhm, there’s supposed to be about 20 46 minutes, which we are right there, uhm, so for closing, so I’m gonna just ask you two to maybe 47 just give a closing remarks. Before we do that though I just want to state that, uhm, there is an Telling Queer History 25 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota LGBT history quiz that we developed here at the Tretter Collection, and 1 so, uhm, there’s 2 actually, so I think what we should do instead of scoring them, uhm, we should let people self-3 score their, uh, quizzes. And we have the answers sheets so, uhm, please be, uhm, uhm, honest 4 ins your scoring of your quiz, and, uh, top three winners will all receive, uhm, a copy of The T Is 5 Not Silent. It’s a new book written by this person named Andrea Jenkins. I heard it’s a pretty 6 good book so, uh, [Audience and Andrea laughs]. The top three scores will, uhm. [Break in film]. 7 With the future of the transgender movement is… can be and should be in your opinion and any 8 other things that you might want to speak up. 9 10 PC: I think that the future of the trans movement is the future of the social progressive movement. 11 Uhm, I think that the trans community, uhm, that we are a very powerful community, the 12 transgender non-conforming community. We are, uhm, a very powerful community that 13 organizes very well. Uhm, that is, that has lots of deep analysis, a lot of brilliant people who are 14 challenging around intersectionality, challenging around, uhm, traditional leadership, uhm, and, 15 and who is at the forefront. Uh, you know, speaking of Black Lives Matter, there have been 16 many queer trans black folks who have been leading that work. Uhm, throughout the country 17 and locally. 18 19 AJ: The founders, the founders were self-identified queer, uhm… 20 21 PC: Black women. 22 23 AJ: … black women, yeah. 24 25 PC: And then locally we have a lot of, uhm, queer and trans black folks that are at the forefront as 26 well. Uhm, and so I think that, you know, uhm, I had a guy, uhm, he’s a great community leader, 27 but he’s, uh, you know, still new to expanding his vision, right, around social progress. And he’s 28 a black man. He was like, “Do you feel like this trans bathroom,” this was a few months ago, “Do 29 you feel like this trans bathroom thing is gonna be finally what breaks the social progressive 30 movement apart?” And, uh, and I was like, that felt very dramatic to me, first of all, obviously. 31 [Audience laughs]. Uhm, cause I was like, “Bathrooms, really?” But, uh, I actually feel quite the 32 opposite. I feel like the trans community, uh, could be the glue that pulls together all these 33 fragmented movements that are going in the same direction, but we are doing it together. So I 34 think that we as a community can really lift up, pull together folks, really change the 35 conversation, move the dial. We have answers, and now we are starting to get a platform to be 36 able to organize. So I think as we move forward and become more visible, we’re gonna be 37 become more visible as leaders in the social progressive movement. Like, uhm, I just wanted to 38 share that, you know, Andrea is a, uh, you know, when Lisa introduced her, she said she’s a 39 leader of the trans community but also she’s a leader in the community, right? Like and I think 40 that is a, you are a perfect example of the changing leadership in our movement, and, uhm, 41 [Audience claps]. And so, absolutely. Cause honestly, I’ve, I’ve been fortunate in the work that I 42 am able to do because of the fact that she created this movement in the first place. So, uhm, so, 43 yeah, there’s now two black trans queer people running around and, you know, and politics 44 spaces, you know, because she created that space in the first place. And so, uhm, I feel like 45 that’s reflective of the movement, period. Mayor, the mayor picked me because she wanted a 46 different voice, different perspective in the work, and I think that’s really, truly one of the 47 reasons also we had so much access to leadership and opportunities is because people are ready Telling Queer History 26 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota to diversify and hear from the trans community. So I think we’re gonna really 1 become leaders in 2 the social progressive movement. 3 4 LC: Yeah, I completely agree with that and, uhm, I think that the community outside the trans 5 community is starting to realize that they can’t do this without us. You know, that we need to 6 be, uhm, apart of the work to make it better. And also just part of the work in general. You 7 know, that, uhm, that we bring value and, uhm, and a lot of, a lot of opportunity to display that, 8 uhm, is by wonderful projects like the Trans Oral History Project. Like Andrea has been saying, it 9 really humanizes trans people and, uhm, and I believe that as we continue to be brave and share 10 our stories that, uhm, it’s going to continue to, uhm, humanize us and hopefully, uhm, create 11 more space for future generations. So, uhm, yes, I do want to thank you, Andrea for all of your 12 work, and it matters so much. [Audience claps]. 13 14 AJ: Well, thank you both, uhm, for not only being here today but for being, uhm, willing and open 15 participants in the Trans Oral History Project but also for, for bringing your brilliance and 16 intelligence and organizing skills to this community. Uhm, you know, this, this program, Telling 17 Queer History, is, is about looking back at history to some extent, right, but today feels like, 18 uhm, you guys are the future of creating histories, and so, uhm, really wanna thank you for 19 being here today. Thank you for being apart of the Trans Oral History Project, and, and thank 20 you for the work that you’re doing and making this world just a little bit better place to live in. 21 Thank you so much. 22 23 PC: Thank you. 24 25 [Audience claps].
