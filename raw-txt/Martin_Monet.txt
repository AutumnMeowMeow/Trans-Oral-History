It’s my voice. 11 12 AJ: Really? 13 14 MM: Yeah, my cousins used to be like, “Monet, put some bass in your voice.” And I’d be like, “What? 15 This is my voice, but...” 16 17 AJ: Right? [Laughs]. 18 19 MM: You know, so. That was like basically it. I didn’t like, like gay bash and get chased on the street or 20 like that. I haven’t experienced stuff like that. 21 22 AJ: You haven’t? 23 24 MM: No, I have not. 25 26 AJ: Right. 27 28 MM: But I have been with a group of transsexuals and some gays that you might find a couple people 29 that wanna act ignorant or something like that. 30 31 AJ: Oh, really? 32 33 MM: But like me just alone… 34 35 AJ: Walking down the street. 36 37 MM: … or something like that. I haven’t been in a predicament like that. And praise god that I don’t 38 come up on something like that. 39 40 AJ: Right. 41 42 MM: Uhm. 43 44 AJ: Especially up in Harlem... 45 46 MM: Yeah. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 9 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: … and the Bronx cause, uhm, I don’t know if 1 you’ve ever heard of… 2 3 MM: I remember somethings in, uhm, New York, plus I was doing, I guess I’m not gonna say all 4 transsexuals but me and some of my click, you know what I’m saying, we used to work on the 5 hoe stroll. 6 7 AJ: Sex work? 8 9 MM: Yeah, sex work. I’m sorry. 10 11 AJ: No. 12 13 MM: Sex work. Sex work out on the street. 14 15 AJ: I mean, I just want, cause some people who may listen to this they may not know what a stroll. 16 17 MM: Oh, okay. Sex work out there in the streets of New York City. 18 19 AJ: Right. 20 21 MM: So, you know, living in Harlem out there in the streets up there working. Not living in the streets 22 but, you know, learning the streets like in Harlem or whatever like that. There’s things you do 23 when you’re coming up being transgender. 24 25 AJ: Right. 26 27 MM: You know, you have some girls out there that have some jobs but the click that I was in we 28 wasn’t really into, we were into that fast money. Money right then and there. 29 30 AJ: Right. 31 32 MM: I have, like, I mean, I have, it’s my past though. It’s my past [uses air quotes]. 33 34 AJ: Right. 35 36 MM: I have robbed, steal, anything like that when I needed to but I did drugs, even though I still do 37 drugs and that’s marijuana. 38 39 AJ: Yeah. 40 41 MM: I don’t smoke weed… oh, I don’t smoke cigarettes. 42 43 AJ: Mhm. 44 45 MM: I don’t do that anymore. I’ve been off of cigarettes for like 6 years, you know. Uhm, but… 46 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 10 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: Uhm, what, you know, you say you and your friends, mostly transgender, 1 transsexuals, uhm… 2 what do you think made you guys be involved in sex work? I mean, I have some ideas too but I 3 want to hear from you. 4 5 MM: Well, like I said it was fast money and the guys, there was just guys out there, you know. They’re 6 just out there, and, you know, they want a piece, not to sound nasty, you know what I’m saying, 7 they want a piece of the… 8 9 AJ: Say whatever you want to say. 10 11 MM: … girls. You know, they was paying so it was like why should I go play around with Larry for free 12 and he probably won’t be worth it. 13 14 AJ: Right. 15 16 MM: Not gonna mess with Frank, and he got some dough for me and he still ain’t worth it. So it was 17 like let me go, let me go mess with Frank. 18 19 AJ: Gotta keep it moving. 20 21 MM: Just keep it moving, not to say that I don’t like to get things on my own but when I was living 22 with my ex-boyfriend I didn’t have to do the sex work. 23 24 AJ: Right. 25 26 MM: Unless I chose to cause he took care of me, you know, but it was fine. I also had my friends out 27 there, and we’re out there hanging out. That kind of draws me out there too. 28 29 AJ: Was it hard to find work as a trans person? 30 31 MM: Uhm, not really. It’s just that what makes it hard for you to find work is if you put the extra work 32 in that you wanted work. You know what I’m saying? If you don’t put the work in that you got 33 that mindset that you want a job, it’s not gonna stick with you. You know, I had jobs before as 34 who I am today, but it was just that, I guess I haven’t found the right job that’s gonna keep me 35 motivated into that job. So that would make me. In other words, I’d rather go get the money for 36 free. 37 38 AJ: Right. 39 40 MM: So… 41 42 AJ: Or get the money easily, more easily. 43 44 MM: Yes. So, just like. 45 46 AJ: Not free. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 11 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MM: 1 Not free. I don’t… 2 3 AJ: There’s some struggles. 4 5 MM: I’ve been in some situations before like that out there on the streets, you know what I’m saying. 6 I have, uhm, been raped twice. 7 8 AJ: Oh, no. 9 10 MM: You know what I’m saying? I had this guy, you know, he had, took me into this, uhm, a bigger 11 building and, you know, I don’t know what made me go up in there. You know, it was dark. So I 12 was like, it’s quick and easy. Go here and get this money cause the money was talking. 13 14 AJ: Right. 15 16 MM: I’m gonna go get it. So I was like in there and he smashes me up, I had to get myself out of that 17 situation so that one. I had one guy, he had, uhm, took me down to, uhm, took me down by the, 18 uhm, river… 19 20 AJ: Mhm. 21 22 MM: … in Harlem. 23 24 AJ: By the river? 25 26 MM: Yeah. He took me down there. Had put out this knife on me and was like give me your money, 27 suck my penis. If you don’t, I’m gonna throw you right in this river. 28 29 AJ: Oh. 30 31 MM: And at that moment it was like, should I fight him because we’re both men or should I just give 32 him everything I just made? So it was like really weird so I was like I don’t want to be thrown in 33 this river, and I was only like 10 feet away from the river. 34 35 AJ: Wow. 36 37 MM: You know what I’m saying? So it’s like… 38 39 AJ: So it’s right there. 40 41 MM: Right there. So like I don’t want to just lose my life over a couple of dollars. 42 43 AJ: Mhm. 44 45 MM: You know what I’m saying? He’s gonna do it or he’s not gonna do it so it’s like, you know what, 46 you can have it. Once I gave it to him, I just ran off. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 12 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Mm. 2 3 MM: You know. So that was the situation. 4 5 AJ: Yeah. Cause that’s really, that’s really what he wanted, right? 6 7 MM: Mhm. 8 9 AJ: I mean he wanted sex, but… 10 11 MM: He wanted my money too. 12 13 AJ: Yeah. 14 15 MM: So I was like, you know what, this, I can make this back in no time so, here you go. Take it. 16 17 AJ: So, when did you first realize, Monet, I’m sorry, that you were… 18 19 MM: Transgender? 20 21 AJ: Yeah. 22 23 MM: Uhm, well, me and my best friend dressed, we was like gay boys… 24 25 AJ: Uhuh. 26 27 MM: … skipping school. 28 29 AJ: Right. 30 31 MM: Should I say his name? 32 33 AJ: Uh, you can if you want to. 34 35 MM: Well, Johnathan… 36 37 AJ: Uhuh. 38 39 MM: … me, him, Matt I said he was 13. I was like 15. 40 41 AJ: Okay. 42 43 MM: I was like 15. Something, 15, 16. One of them, but I was young though. And, uhm, once we got 44 together, got hooked up the first day, you couldn’t split us apart. 45 46 AJ: What split apart? 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 13 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MM: I said, you could not 1 split us apart. 2 3 AJ: Oh, the first day that you met y’all were tight. 4 5 MM: We were stuck together like that [puts hands together]. 6 7 AJ: Right. 8 9 MM: And, uhm, we, uhm, like feed off each other. You know, like lets wear these little shorts and let’s 10 wear these high tops. 11 12 AJ: Uhuh. 13 14 MM: I just be like alright we’re gonna do this. So we would wear stuff like that. And sometimes we 15 would skip school. Tell our parents we were in school and meet up at the 5. That’s the 5 bus 16 right there? 17 18 AJ: Yeah, that goes down Chicago. 19 20 MM: Yeah, so we used to meet right there, over there and get on the bus and go right to the Mall of 21 America. Stay at the Mall of America all day. Boys thinking we girls, just running around in the 22 mall. And we know when to go home. Okay, school’s out. We need to go home right now. So we 23 come back using the same bus. 24 25 AJ: Mhm. 26 27 MM: Going back home so we would get off. He go home. I go home. They we’d connect right back up 28 that night. 29 30 AJ: Did you guys, like, change clothes once you left the house? 31 32 MM: Mhm. I remember one time. You wanna know an incident? I remember one time I went home. I 33 went to school, and I came home from school cause, you know, parents like to clean the houses 34 up and clean your rooms. 35 36 AJ: Right. Before you do. 37 38 MM: So, mhm. I came home from school, and she had these foam breasts. I used to wear these fake 39 breasts… 40 41 AJ: Right. 42 43 MM: … as I do drag. I did more than he did, but, you know, we used to do drag. So my mother was 44 like, she was like, “who’s are these?” I was like, “Oh, this is my friend’s.” She was like, “You is 45 lying. Both is yours.” I was like, she was like, “Are you dressing up like a girl?” My mother, she 46 was, she was a sweet woman. She wasn’t an evil woman. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 14 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Uhuh. 2 3 MM: It was just something that that was difficult for her, something she had. I’m not saying she had 4 to, you know what I’m saying? Something that, how can I say it? She got used to it. Once it was 5 explained to her by my aunts and uncles and stuff… 6 7 AJ: Mhm. 8 9 MM: … you know, she understood it but I guess I went around it the wrong way. It just popped out 10 like popcorn. 11 12 AJ: Oh, wow. 13 14 MM: So it was like, what? Kind of, you know what I’m saying? So you know, I can understand my part, 15 but you know I was a child. 16 17 AJ: Is your mother still alive? 18 19 MM: My brother? My mother? No, my mother passed away, uhm, in ’97.

I don’t care. 29 30 AJ: Yeah. [Laughs]. 31 32 MM: My dad wasn’t bothering me. It was just him protecting me. 33 34 AJ: Right. 35 36 MM: So, I had to understand that. 37 38 AJ: He’s just trying to be a dad. He’s worried about his little girl. 39 40 MM: And, you know, so it’s like kind of different than having, I think if I would have been different, if I 41 was my old way and grown, he probably wouldn’t have that much to say. 42 43 AJ: Sure. 44 45 MM: But now that I’m this female, so it’s like different for him. 46 47 AJ: Right. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 18 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MM: So I can understand that. 3 4 AJ: I can understand that too. Like does he, buy you Christmas gifts or… 5 6 MM: Uhm, he don’t buy me Christmas gifts. I’m gonna get after him on that though. 7 8 AJ: Okay. [Laughs]. 9 10 MM: My favorite place is Victoria’s Secret but, no, you can just send me a gift card. I can take that. 11 12 AJ: But he’s, he’s cool though? 13 14 MM: He’s fine with it. 15 16 AJ: He houses you, you have dinner… 17 18 MM: Yeah, if I stay more than a night, I stay like 3 or 4 nights so he’s comfortable with me. He’s cool. 19 We talk, you know what I’m saying? Still to this day. 20 21 AJ: What about your aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters? 22 23 MM: Yeah, I have a brother. 24 25 AJ: Uhuh. You said that. 26 27 MM: Yeah, he’s younger than me and I have, uhm… 28 29 AJ: And you guys are still close? 30 31 MM: Yeah. Yeah, I can call him up right now. 32 33 AJ: Okay. He calls you Monet? 34 35 MM: He calls me Monet. No, everybody calls me Kisha. 36 37 AJ: Kisha. 38 39 MM: Okay, Kisha is like, I’m gonna say Kisha is like my boom, boom, boom. Monet is more like when I 40 need warehouse or get my food stamps together. Oh, “Monet.” Oh, “Hey, I’m right here.” 41 Monet is on everything. 42 43 AJ: Right. 44 45 MM: But Kisha is more like hanging out with my girlfriends and plus they grew up with me so that 46 name is not going anywhere. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 19 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Right, exactly. 2 3 MM: So, yeah, my brother, he calls me Kisha. I got 2 nephews, 1 niece, and they love me… 4 5 AJ: Uhuh. 6 7 MM: … like there’s no other. And they support me. You know, and their mom and aunts. I have aunts, 8 uncles, cousins, and they all support me and they love me. They don’t… 9 10 AJ: The only reason I ask is cause, you know, that so many trans… 11 12 MM: There’s so many girls out there, not to be funny, there’s so many transgender women, there’s 13 some gay guys out there too that as soon as they come out to their family, their family just 14 pretty much [places towel in front of her face]. 15 16 AJ: Right. 17 18 MM: You know what I’m saying? That’s like, to me that’s crazy. Like you should support and love your 19 child for whoever they are, whatever they want to be, whatever they wanna do. You should be 20 there whether you’re a parent or not, you know what I’m saying? 21 22 AJ: Right. 23 24 MM: This is somebody that you raised or something. Don’t just kick them… 25 26 AJ: To the curb. 27 28 MM: Right. We do have feelings too. You know, we just change our life into something that you don’t 29 want us to me and something that you’re not comfortable with, you know what I’m saying? 30 When I was, let me tell you something about that part. When my aunt had, uhm, told me that I 31 couldn’t come to my grandmother anymore because I was, uhm, transgender, you know what 32 I’m saying? She said I could come, but she wanted me to peel out, and what peel out means is 33 that she wants me to change myself back over to a man… 34 35 AJ: Right. 36 37 MM: … to attend my grandmother’s funeral. You know what I said, I said, “Fuck you. I’m not coming 38 out of anything for anybody just to make anybody happy.” 39 40 AJ: Right. 41 42 MM: Because I’m not gonna be happy. I’m gonna feel so uncomfortable. I have breasts and do you 43 want me to put on, dress as a man? Are you crazy? You’re not gonna embarrass men like that. 44 45 AJ: Yes. 46 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 20 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MM: I’m not gonna stand for that. So that’s somethings that some girls need 1 to stand up for 2 themselves when it comes to communities… 3 4 AJ: Plus your grandmother, she was… 5 6 MM: My grandmother, she, no, she knows me as Kisha. You know what I’m saying? She didn’t seen 7 me a lot as soon as I moved to New York City, you know what I’m saying. They lived in Kansas 8 City, Missouri you know what I’m saying? That’s where my background comes from. 9 10 AJ: Uhuh. 11 12 MM: My mother was born and raised, well, she wasn’t raised there but… 13 14 AJ: But she was born in New York City. 15 16 MM: Excuse me, I don’t mean to burp, but, yeah. So that’s where all my, excuse me, that’s where all 17 my cousins are at, you know, is there. So, when she said that it was more like, “Well, fuck you. 18 I’m not gonna go change myself just to make you happy.” 19 20 AJ: Right. 21 22 MM: “And embarrass me in front of all these people.” I’m not gonna do that. So this time, my, uhm, 23 my aunt had passed away. Oh, a little emotional, but my aunt had passed away before 24 Thanksgiving. I’m getting emotional, sorry. 25 26 AJ: That’s okay. 27 28 MM: And, uhm, them hormones get you so emotional. You hear me? 29 30 AJ: Yes, they do. 31 32 MM: And, uhm… 33 34 AJ: I understand. 35 36 MM: We had made plans and everything for her to come visit me and stuff like that, and she had died 37 like probably like two weeks before. 38 39 AJ: Was she real sick or…? 40 41 MM: No, she just, it just, my cousin said he came home, and she was, uhm, laying on the floor. I guess 42 she hit her head and passed out or something. 43 44 AJ: Oh. 45 46 MM: So, that was really emotional to me because we talked every day on the phone, on facetime. 47 And, you know, she used to tell me, oh your hair looks pretty and we had made plans for her to Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 21 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota come down to see me for Thanksgiving, and I was going up there to Vegas with 1 her. It was like 2 really hard for me, you know what I’m saying? But, you know, and… 3 4 AJ: Did you make it to the funeral? 5 6 MM: Oh, I went to this funeral, you know what I’m saying. So, yes, I went to this funeral. 7 8 AJ: Okay. 9 10 MM: So, uhm, I had to go because all my cousins and everybody, you know what I’m saying, they was 11 like, “You coming.” So, I was like, “I know.” I had to come. 12 13 AJ: Right. 14 15 MM: So, the same that told me that she wanted me to transform myself back to being a man or 16 whatever, you know, she accepts me. She accepts me. It took a long time cause she’s a Christian 17 woman. 18 19 AJ: Right. 20 21 MM: It took her a little minute but now she understands that this right here is not going nowhere. 22 23 AJ: Right. 24 25 MM: So when she, uhm, time for the funeral, so go to the funeral, so she was, I wouldn’t say that, I 26 just sit there and wait for people. So I would just sit there, you know, and she had made these 27 flowers for all the family to wear on their shirts, on their dresses. You know what I’m saying. But 28 I wore me some tight fitting jeans, and, you know, I was still looking like me so I felt 29 comfortable. You know? And, uhm, she had all the boys like little flowers. So I was sitting there 30 waiting patiently, you know. She was like, she walks up on me, and she was like I already know, I 31 already know that you a big flower for the females. So that made me, that made me feel special, 32 you know what I’m saying. 33 34 AJ: Yes. 35 36 MM: Okay, so now she understands then. Took her a couple of years but, yeah, it made me feel 37 special. 38 39 AJ: She came around. 40 41 MM: Yeah. You know what I’m saying? It’s hope I feel for some people. It’s all about, cause, you 42 know, I’m not gonna say some people push some gays and some trans away. Sometimes it how 43 that person approaches their family. 44 45 AJ: Yeah. 46 47 MM: You know what I’m saying? So. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 22 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Wow.

There was times when I would go turn me a trick and see that 12 hormone lady walking down the street. I’d be like, “baby stop for me.” And it was Jose. I’d like 13 like, “Jose!” She’d be like, “You coming to get this shot, right bitch?” I’d be like, “Yeah, give me 14 like 2 minutes.” 15 16 AJ: Okay. 17 18 MM: So she pulls her car over. I get in the car. I give her my little $40 and boom, boom. They used to 19 be called champagne, but they would be mixed with different hormones up in there. You know 20 what I’m saying. Yeah. And, uhm, I’d come off, and she’d be like, I’d be right there next to the 21 garbage can, right there bending over the garbage can while she’s sticking me with the 22 hormones. 23 24 AJ: Oh my goodness. 25 26 MM: Mhm. In the restaurant, whatever. Just give it to me. Let’s go. Went to the doctor’s and I was 27 like I’m not gonna keep paying for hormones… 28 29 AJ: Uhuh. 30 31 MM: … for somebody when I could just get my lazy ass up… 32 33 AJ: Mhm. 34 35 MM: … and go to the doctor… 36 37 AJ: Right. 38 39 MM: … talk to a doctor. 40 41 AJ: Yeah. 42 43 MM: So once I got my lazy ass up… 44 45 AJ: Okay. 46 47 MM: … start talking to a doctor.

They ain’t saggy.” 7 I was like, “I don’t think I’m gonna do it no more.” Then I thought about going to have the whole 8 sex change. I thought about going to take that off, but then I thought about it, and I was like, “I 9 don’t think I want it done cause I kind of like looking like a freak and being a freak.” I’m not a 10 freak. 11 12 AJ: No, say more about this. This is really important. 13 14 MM: Well, I thought about having a sex change, but then it was just like my mind ain’t focused on it 15 cause I am a freak cause this is what god, this is in 2017. 16 17 AJ: Yeah. 18 19 MM: Men like transsexuals. 20 21 AJ: Right. 22 23 MM: You know what I’m saying, so get my sex change is not in my mind anymore. 24 25 AJ: I had a friend tell me a long time ago, uhm, that she regretted getting a full sex change.

You know what I’m saying? 26 27 AJ: Mhm. 28 29 MM: Not too much a female so the only time I really get into telling them my business really with 30 females is when I’ve been drinking. 31 32 AJ: Right. 33 34 MM: Once I’ve been drinking I start talking. 35 36 AJ: Okay. [Laughs]. 37 38 MM: So, that comes through but, me, if a guy approaches me, I just tell him right, then, and there, 39 you know what I’m saying, I will be like, let me tell you something, me as a man, I still think 40 about the men cause I still think about the women. 41 42 AJ: Mhm. 43 44 MM: But when it comes to sex, that’s when you gotta think about the man, okay. He don’t, he don’t 45 even know I’m a man so I gotta be like here I go. “Do you know that I’m a transsexual?” 46 47 AJ: Mhm. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 31 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MM: And it’s up to them if they’re gonna take it or they won’t take it. And to be honest with you I 3 don’t care if they take it or they don’t take it. 4 5 AJ: So what do most guys say? 6 7 MM: When I, when I, when they, I get down. I’m gonna say like, mm, 79-80%... 8 9 AJ: Wow. 10 11 MM: … is good with me. You know what I’m saying. 12 13 AJ: And then a few guys are not good. 14 15 MM: Are no good.

Damn, that’s when I’m thinking in my mind, I wish I had 24 me a pussy. 25 26 AJ: Right. 27 28 MM: But when you do that sometimes, you know what I’m saying, some don’t lose your number. 29 They’re just hit you up on the low. Be like, “I’m just checking to see how you’re doing.” Be like, 30 “Who’s this?” And they’re like, “Well, who is this?” And once you tell them, they’re like, “Oh, oh, 31 I forgot I had your number, but, yeah, how you doing?” “I’m doing good.” And you tell yourself, 32 “Oh, he just wants some ass.” 33 34 AJ: Right. 35 36 MM: He ain’t getting no ass from his real woman so he want to come to use me. So once he’s trying 37 to use me, I start trying to use them pockets. 38 39 AJ: Okay. 40 41 MM: No one is going to eat me, buy me a cheeseburger, and then shit me out. 42 43 AJ: Oh, that’s right. 44 45 MM: You wanna have sex, okay, boom.

He works in jail. So I don’t always have to use my money. So that’s a good thing about 35 him. 36 37 AJ: Mhm. 38 39 MM: He takes everything he can of his own. I don’t have to do anything. 40 41 AJ: Okay. 42 43 MM: That’s how it works. 44 45 AJ: Does he have his own phone then? 46 47 MM: No, he ain’t got his own phone. He has his own tablet. He has his own TV. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 34 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Uhuh. 3 4 MM: He has since I’ve been talking to him the last three months, you know what I’m saying, he been 5 working so it’s been good for me.

Do you like it up there? 37 38 MM: Mm… 39 40 AJ: [Laughs]. 41 42 MM: Nobody really likes the Bronx but, you know, fuck it, it’s cheaper. 43 44 AJ: Yeah. 45 46 MM: And I love Harlem cause it’s so everything is different. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 35 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Yeah, I think so. 2 3 MM: You know, they have their own different look. 4 5 AJ: Mhm. 6 7 MM: They’re own different… 8 9 AJ: Feel. 10 11 MM: Yeah, so I usually hang out in Brooklyn. The last time I’ve been to Queens was when I went to 12 jail. Uhm, and my ex-boyfriend was going back and forth to jail to go visit him in the jail system. 13 Go visit him out there. They had two beds. One year, he did one year and then down the line 14 another year so it was like I was going to visit. 15 16 AJ: So when you went, you, were you there for a long time or? 17 18 MM: When I went to jail? 19 20 AJ: Uhuh. 21 22 MM: For me? 23 24 AJ: A couple days yeah, for you. 25 26 MM: Uh, no, girl. The longest, okay, you wanna talk about that. We can talk about that. Okay. Uhm, I 27 mean, my first time going to jail ever in New York City was me and my friend. He was a gay guy. 28 We ain’t friends no more but we was coming from Connecticut. The metro north and it’s only 29 like an hour, two hours on the train. 30 31 AJ: Mhm. 32 33 MM: All around on the train. And we catch a train going to New York and stay in New York all night. 34 35 AJ: Mhm. 36 37 MM: … and catch the first train back. The first train started running at like 6 in the morning. 38 39 AJ: Right. 40 41 MM: So if you going to New York on that last train, you gotta hang out the whole night. So we was 42 walking down a street in Times Square [laughs], and we just smoking a blunt. Just smoking, 43 walking, smoking and walking. And this white man walks up. He was like put your hand behind 44 your back. I was like, “What?” “Put your hands behind your back.” I was like, “No way.” He was 45 like, “You’re under arrest.” I was like, “Oh shit. Like, fuck.” 46 47 AJ: Uhuh. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 36 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MM: So took me to jail. I didn’t go home but my friend that I was with he went home. But this little 3 fucker have the nerve to come to me while I’m in jail, “Oh, do you have like $20 I can have to get 4 back on the train?” I was like, “No.” Even though I had it. You’re going home. I’m not. So you’re 5 going to have to get home on your own. 6 7 AJ: Yeah. You guys were smoking crack? 8 9 MM: No, marijuana. Weed. 10 11 AJ: Weed. Okay. 12 13 MM: I have never trusted them in my life and never will touch that. And I say that because when you 14 look at people, you can look at people, when you see people out on the streets looking like that, 15 you don’t wanna look like that. 16 17 AJ: Like a zombie. 18 19 MM: Yes, and I don’t have time for that. I’d rather have blunts all day, every day. 20 21 AJ: Mhm. 22 23 MM: You know what I’m saying? No matter what, I smoke my blunts every day and drink my wine. 24 25 AJ: Right. 26 27 MM: And that does me just fine. Oh, it was a little rhyme. 28 29 AJ: Yeah. [Laughs]. 30 31 MM: But, you know, I’ll do that. You know what I’m saying. 32 33 AJ: Roll my blunt. Drink my wine. 34 35 MM: Yeah. 36 37 AJ: I’ll be just fine. 38 39 MM: Mhm. I not gonna say I haven’t done like… I did cocaine, you know what I’m saying. 40 41 AJ: Mhm. 42 43 MM: That’s, I’ll do that too every once in a blue, but I haven’t touched it in a minute. 44 45 AJ: Yeah. 46 47 MM: It’s not every day serious to me. Uhm, but yeah. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 37 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: So you guys, you didn’t stay long? 3 4 MM: Oh, yes, I did. So, uhm, we, they told me I had to, oh my god, you see how she looks over there 5 using all those? Uhuh. 6 7 AJ: Mhm. 8 9 MM: So I had my first time going. No, I was in the tombs in New York. I was in the tombs. That’s 10 Manhattan, New York. 11 12 AJ: Mhm. 13 14 MM: You ever just go wondering in the street? That’s where the big courthouses are at. 15 16 AJ: Oh, okay. 17 18 MM: That’s where everybody goes. Superstars, everybody. 19 20 AJ: Oh, wow. 21 22 MM: Yeah, the tombs. And, uhm, I was there for like a month. 23 24 AJ: Oh. 25 26 MM: Yeah, almost a month, yeah, almost a month. I was there for a month going on almost 3 weeks, 27 like a month and three weeks, like a month and a half. 28 29 AJ: Mhm. 30 31 MM: A month and a half, something like that. And I went court. So when I went to court they were 32 like, “Oh, well, we can’t send you home because you have a warrant in Kansas City, Missouri.” 33 So I was like, “Excuse me?” I forgot all about that. 34 35 AJ: Okay. 36 37 MM: So I was like, “Excuse me? A warrant in Kansas City?” So I thought about it, thought about it, 38 thought about it. I was like, “Oh my god. From the drugs. Cause I was with my cousins, and, 39 uhm, it was like, cause they was selling crack… 40 41 AJ: Mhm. 42 43 MM: … to the crackheads out there. So we got in the car and my cousin, the police pulled up their car. 44 The police pulled up as we were parking. And my cousin was like, “Oh my god. What do we do?” 45 I said, “Just give it to me. I’m gonna put it in my bag.” 46 47 AJ: Mhm. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 38 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MM: I was so nervous. I was like, “Should I swallow it?” I was like, “No, no, don’t swallow it.” I spit it 3 out, and I put it in my bag. But I wasn’t thinking they were gonna check the car. 4 5 AJ: Right. 6 7 MM: You know what I’m saying? I thought he was just gonna pull us over, but he pulled us over. He 8 was like, “I’m gonna check the car.” And ding, ding he saw my bag. He opened the bag up. So, he 9 started looking in my bag, and he was like, “Oh, what’s this?” I was like, “Uh, it’s mine.” 10 11 AJ: Oh. 12 13 MM: So I took the blame for my cousin. He didn’t say like, “Take the blame.” 14 15 AJ: Right but you… 16 17 MM: I was, so I just took the blame. And the whole time I was there my cousin took care of me 18 though the whole time I was there. 19 20 AJ: Hm. 21 22 MM: I was only there for like two weeks. 23 24 AJ: Mhm. 25 26 MM: You know? But, moving forward so when Kansas City came and picked me up I was so mad. 27 28 AJ: Oh so they came to New York to get you. 29 30 MM: Mhm. 31 32 AJ: Oh wow. 33 34 MM: They came and picked me up. So when they came and picked me up, I was like, “Oh my god. 35 What am I gonna do? Like, how am I gonna get back home?” That’s all in my head, like how am I 36 gonna get back home from Kansas City, Missouri? 37 38 AJ: Uhuh. 39 40 MM: So they come and pick me up. And they, uhm, it was so embarrassing. They had shackled me 41 from head to toe. 42 43 AJ: Oh no. 44 45 MM: So I had to walk through the airport like [stomps feet back and forth]. So embarrassing. I got on 46 a plane. I was the first one on the plane. It was so embarrassing. Everybody just knew I was a Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 39 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota convict. It was just so embarrassing. So when they took me down from the plane, 1 I go to the jail, 2 the first person I see, guess who it is? My cousin. 3 4 AJ: What? 5 6 MM: Yes, so I come in. He calls me by my first name. Ah, ah, I gotchu. I’m not gonna tell you my first 7 name. So he calls me by my first name. So I was like, “Oh, shit. Hey. So the last time I seen you 8 was in jail.” So we went home. 9 10 AJ: Uhuh. 11 12 MM: So I did my one of my ex best friends. We ain’t friends really no more. Her name is Shakara. She 13 lives in New Haven, Connecticut. And she had paid my way all the way from Kansas City all the 14 way back to home to Connecticut. 15 16 AJ: So they didn’t keep you at the court? 17 18 MM: I went to court, and they kicked my ass out. [Laughs]. It was like, “Get out now!” I’m gonna be 19 like, “Oh my god, like this is like 20, I forget what year it was. It was when Puff Daddy and Jay Lo 20 were doing that gunshot… 21 22 AJ: A while ago. 23 24 MM: Yes. So it was like, I could just, they just had me in New York. Nobody came and get me, they 25 just kick me out of courtroom and tell me to go home. Like you serious? So that was my first 26 time ever getting locked up on the east coast. And then from that point came the train, you 27 know what I’m saying? So I remember me and my best friend in Connecticut, her name is 28 Shakara like I said. 29 30 AJ: Shakara? 31 32 MM: Mhm, we used to, uhm… 33 34 AJ: S.A.H… S.H.A… 35 36 MM: Something, oh. I forget her name, but. 37 38 AJ: Q.U.R.A.? 39 40 MM: Oh, no, no Q. 41 42 AJ: Okay. 43 44 MM: But she had, uhm, we had, we used to rob dates, you know what I’m saying. When I’m sitting 45 with them, so it was more like, we had this act going called salt and pepper. You know, she was 46 white. I was black. So we were salt and pepper. So, uhm, the date was like, “Hey, what’s up, Salt 47 and Pepper?” We were like, “Yeah.” He’s like, “What’s, uhm, Pepper, I want, tell Salt to come Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 40 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota here.” So it would be something like that where they want pepper or, it was 1 like scriptural. Or 2 they want both of us. I think it was like, okay, I’m gonna go in to get this money and get the hell 3 up out of here. So she goes in there. I wait like 5 minutes. Let him feel up on her, suck her tities, 4 whatever he was doing to her. 5 6 AJ: Right. 7 8 MM: I wait like 5 minutes. And my thing, I think was pretty much, [knocks on table], “Oh shit, oh 9 that’s my girlfriend. Oh, that’s my girlfriend.” Like that. He would be like, “Okay.” And I’d be like, 10 “Oh my god, can I use the bathroom?” And he’d be like, “I told you to ask to use the bathroom.” 11 Look this is our scam. 12 13 AJ: Right. 14 15 MM: “Oh my god, could I please use the bathroom?” “Oh, come on in, come on in. Use the 16 bathroom.” So I go in the bathroom. I help him in the bathroom. She’s sitting on him, sucking his 17 tities, whatever or he might be sucking her dingaling, you know what I’m saying? But he’s 18 covered up and can’t see nothing. 19 20 AJ: Yeah. 21 22 MM: Come out, robbing him. I’m in his pockets or she’s in the pockets or getting credit cards and we 23 out of there. So that’s… 24 25 AJ: So y’all aren’t beating people up and taking… 26 27 MM: No. It’s more like suck tities, suck a, you know what I’m saying? Something like that. It would be 28 a switcheroo thing cause that was our stand, but one time it caught up with us. Alright. And, 29 uhm, we had one credit card. This is my first time being locked up in Connecticut. 30 31 AJ: Uhuh. 32 33 MM: We had the credit card. We go to the, uhm, mall. And, some, we was always buying stuff. 34 Particularly, this particular day it was like sit your ass at home and don’t you do nothing. And I’m 35 telling her, I’m saying, I was like, “I want a massage.” Excuse me. We’re going back and forth. So 36 we kind of, excuse me, looked weird. So I signed it, and the card came back stolen. 37 38 AJ: Mm. 39 40 MM: So when they said it like that, I was like, “Okay, it’s time to go.” I was walking out of the mall, I 41 was taking, like out of that store, I was taking the credit cards and putting them inside clothes, 42 you know what I’m saying? So they don’t catch it on me. So that’s what I was doing. So we got 43 out of that store. We was walking, and they kept saying, “Ma’am, ma’am, excuse me, ma’am, 44 ma’am, like excuse me.” They kept addressing me, and I just kept, hm, hm, hm. 45 46 AJ: [Laughs]. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 41 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MM: They came in, [brings hands together]. I was like, “What happened?” It was 1 like, “Well, you 2 know what happened. Your credit card was stolen. Your credit card was stolen.” They took me 3 and her to jail. And we had, good thing we was good with the bail bondsmen cause we barely 4 had enough money to bail our asses out. All we had to do was ask for him to come pick us up. 5 He picked us up, and that was it. But we paid him too while we was out, you know what I’m 6 saying. That was a good thing that we didn’t stay there anymore. But then one time my own 7 probation officer set me up, and, uhm, she was like, this was my first time going to prison. She 8 had set me up. And she was like, “Oh come on in. We have some paperwork for you to sign.” So, 9 you know, I was like, “Oh yeah, coming in now. I’m gonna go sign these papers. And then I’m 10 gonna come back out, and we’re gonna go do this.” 11 12 AJ: Uhuh. 13 14 MM: My mind is already focused on what I’m gonna do that day. So I put my new brand new little 15 outfit on, my little Guess outfit, my brand new Airmax Form. 16 17 AJ: Uhuh. 18 19 MM: So I go see her. She was like, “Hey, how you doing? Come on back. Come on back to my office.” I 20 go to her office, the door slams. Bam! I was like, [turns head back]. She was like, “You’re under 21 arrest.” I was like, “For what?” I forget what I violated for. They took me to, uhm, this prison. It’s 22 called Osborne. It’s like, probably like 3 hours away… 23 24 AJ: Hm. 25 26 MM: … from New Haven, Connecticut, but it’s still in Connecticut. It was like up Connecticut by like 27 New London and stuff like that. 28 29 AJ: Oh wow. 30 31 MM: It was deep up there. I mean so deep the water tasked so different from the city. 32 33 AJ: Oh wow. 34 35 MM: You know what I’m saying? It was so deep. And that was my first time going to prison. And when 36 I went into those doors, I wanted to take a dookie on myself but I didn’t. It was just so scary to 37 go into a prison. So when they open up those, they, uhm, took me to my little cell block I was 38 going to. All, it was like, probably like two o’clock at night or something like that. But all I know is 39 that the doors for me to come into that dorm, all them guys was at the gate like, “Oh, hey, come 40 here. Come up here.” I was like, I’m gonna keep to myself. 41 42 AJ: You were put in with all the guys? 43 44 MM: Mhm, all the guys. They only way they put you in the female jail, if that’s gone. You can have tits 45 and everything, you know, you going right to the men’s jail. 46 47 AJ: So you have to have a sex change. Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 42 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MM: You have to have the whole sex change to go to a female cause they still view us as men, you 3 know what I’m saying. They still… 4 5 AJ: How did that feel for you? 6 7 MM: I say one thing, I ain’t been back. 8 9 AJ: I know, that’s right. 10 11 MM: Mhm. It feels, it feels, first, this is how I look at it. If I don’t get myself in trouble I won’t worry 12 about that part of society treating me like a man. 13 14 AJ: Mhm. 15 16 MM: You know what I’m saying? Cause that’s not who I am today. 17 18 AJ: Right. 19 20 MM: So, it’s like when they put you in there with all those men, some people, some gays like it cause 21 they might be horny with the boys. With me I don’t think like that, you know what I’m saying? 22 That’s not the kind of person I am. I’m here, I was just ready to do my time and go the fuck 23 home. 24 25 AJ: Right. 26 27 MM: I don’t got time to be suck your dick for a soup because I’m gonna get that for free so why would 28 I do anything with you? So it’s just like… 29 30 AJ: Yeah, exactly. 31 32 MM: I just couldn’t see myself… 33 34 AJ: So the guys in jail treat you like a guy? 35 36 MM: [Shakes head no]. Like the woman I was. They treat me like the woman I was cause I was good 37 with them. The only ones that gave me attitude and shit like that was the females see you in. 38 But they respected me, and they called me by my first name. 39 40 AJ: Uhuh. 41 42 MM: Back then my name wasn’t changed. So they only call me by my last name. 43 44 AJ: Uhuh. 45 46 MM: So I just respected that, you know what I’m saying. But with some people I just take the bullshit. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 43 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: So you didn’t get beat 1 up or anything. 2 3 MM: Nope. My first time going I almost had that part, but yeah my first time going I was, I went to the 4 CEO, and, uhm, they were telling us that, you know, you gotta take a shower. You need to do 5 this for the night. So I was like, “Oh, okay.” Then go get me a towel, and, uhm, I just took my 6 braids out. My hair was red like your shirt. I had my hair red. It was cornrowed, having the braids 7 in the back or whatever. And I was like washing my hands and my hair out so I’m gonna take my 8 hair out. So I go and see, cause on this side it was like two showers. 9 10 AJ: Mhm. 11 12 MM: So I asked her if I could go to the other side because the side I was on up. Everybody was taking 13 a shower and on the other side it was like locked in, and they couldn’t come out. They had to do 14 what they had to do. So when I asked her, she was just like, “You can go do what you wanna do. 15 I don’t care.” She would just give me that. So I was like, “Okay.” So I’m gonna go to the other 16 side where it’s quiet. Everybody is over there sleeping so I can go in this shower. I’m gonna be 17 by myself. 18 19 AJ: Right. 20 21 MM: All I know is I go in there, I wet my hair up, came out into the open, washing the soap off my 22 eyes and my hair, and this guy came and started groping me. And I was like, “Uh-uh. What are 23 you doing? I’m not doing that.” I see her walk by. They had to see him go over there walking by 24 swinging his keys. Like, like he ain’t gonna come in and stop us or what was going on. So it was 25 like weird. So I know I just got my ass out of there and went back to my cell. I didn’t even finish 26 my damn shower. 27 28 AJ: Wow. 29 30 MM: A couple of days later, uhm, the CEO calls me down to the to, uhm, to the desk, and said, “The 31 captain wants to speak to you.” I kind of forgot about the situation so I was like, “For what?” But 32 then I thought about it, and I was like, “Oh. Cause this damn shower situation.” So it’s a good 33 thing that, I didn’t know that it was boy that cleans up the jail. 34 35 AJ: Mhm. 36 37 MM: So I didn’t know that he was watching from, cause they have these cameras like this, and he was 38 watching in the shower through his thing watching what was going on. So it was a good thing 39 that he was a peeping tom on my ass. 40 41 AJ: Right. [Laughs]. Cause it kept you from getting in trouble. 42 43 MM: Mhm. So, he, the captain wanted to hear my side or whatever so I told him what was going on. 44 So once I told him what was going on and what was [claps hands together], you know, they, 45 uhm, so I go back upstairs and probably like a day or two later they went and got him and took 46 him to the box, to the hole. 47 Monet (Kisha) Martin Interview 44 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Hm. 2 3 MM: Mhm. So. 4 5 AJ: Let me ask you this one last question cause we’re about to, you know, get to our time.
