Breatta Bee Amore 11 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota BBA: Oh, when I found out I was transgender, I was hanging out with Deja. One 1 day she made me up 2 and I couldn’t believe who I looked like. I looked like Angela Winbush or Diana Ross . . . 3 AJ: Angela Winbush, Diana Ross. 4 BBA: All the Black girls - Gladys Knight, all the girls. But, yeah, Deja . . . 5 AJ: So, were you a performer too? 6 BBA: Yeah, we all worked at the 90s. 7 AJ: Really? 8 BBA: Yeah. I got hired as one of the La Femme girls by Nina and Cee Cee Russell. 9 AJ: OK. 10 BBA: Child, they had me. OK, I moved from Central Avenue, I moved on to Hennepin, right across the 11 street from the library in a high rise apartment here. There was a queen named Richard that 12 lived in there and she would do shows at the Brass Rail. So, one day she . . . she just said, 13 “Wow.” I did that for about a month, that was before she asked me to do a show for her at the 14 Brass Rail. I did not know it was going to be whole review show, for a whole 30 days. They 15 wanted me bad. 16 AJ: So, you thought it was just going to be like one night, and it was for 30 days. A whole review. 17 BBA: Girl, I made like $20,000. 18 AJ: Is that right? For 30 days? 19 BBA: Yeah. 20 AJ: Oh, my goodness. 21 BBA: Had my name on the building and inside the bar, across the bar – it was going this way, that 22 way. [Inaudible 17:25] what my performance was, Deja performed with us too, but they were 23 really taking me because I could really perform so, Nina and Cee Cee came to see my show and 24 that’s when they told me to come join the 90s and I performed there. I performed at the 90s, 25 downstairs on Wednesday night. You know, on Wednesday nights downstairs [inaudible 17:55]. 26 So, I performed there and then Nina called me on the telephone after I got home, right after she 27 got home from the 90s, and told me, “I want to make you a La Femme girl because you can 28 really perform.” 29 AJ: Oh, wow. Oh, my goodness. So, you used to do Glady Knight, Diana Ross? 30 BBA: Right, Diana Ross. 31 AJ: Diana Ross. 32 BBA: I used to do Natalie Cole. 33 AJ: Natalie Cole.

So, you were saying, though, that Deja is the one – she made you up and 10 you just felt really comfortable? 11 BBA: Yeah, more comfortable and I looked good. We used to go out and I’m going to tell you 12 something about Deja. I met her at a Gay Pride event. 13 AJ: At a Gay Pride event? 14 BBA: Yeah, at Minnehaha Falls park. 15 AJ: Yeah, I think I remember that event – I was there. 16 BBA: An AIDS walk and a picnic. 17 AJ: AIDS walk and a picnic, yes. 18 BBA: At the picnic, I saw Deja playing with four little kids. This was when I was working for Tom and . . 19 . what’s his name? The name is making me . . . what’s his name again? He had Minnesota Men 20 of Color – what was that man’s name? 21 AJ: Oh, Nick. 22 BBA: Yeah, Nick Metcalf and Tom. OK, they took me to the AIDS walk and the picnic and that’s where 23 I saw Deja. 24 AJ: Roxanne used to work there to. 25 BBA: Yeah, she worked there with us when me and Deja worked there. I think another person . . . it 26 wasn’t Anna . . . the one that wore the brim hat with the little glasses – her. Dark-haired girl 27 with the round-rimmed glasses. 28 AJ: Rochelle? 29 BBA: Is that her name? 30 AJ: She hangs out with . . . does she hang out with . . . 31 BBA: I need some water. Breatta Bee Amore 13 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: Now remember you’ve got your 1 microphone on. 2 BBA: I know I’ve got to take it off before I get some water . . . 3 AJ: Hang on, where’s your water?

Well, let me stop the tape for a minute then. 6 BBA: My mouth is getting dry. 7 AJ: So, we are back – got some water, feeling a little better? 8 BBA: Yes, thank you, Andrea. 9 AJ: No problem. So, you know, you were kind of telling me about Deja and how she . . . 10 BBA: Oh, yeah. Deja was a very good influence on me. I knew she worked, I knew she did it on her 11 own, but what happened to Deja, she got evicted from her apartment so she ended up moving 12 in with me. We became the very best of friends. 13 AJ: And this was after you guys met at the AIDS event over at Minnehaha Park. 14 BBA: Yeah. She was working for Macys but they fired her, I don’t know why. Maybe they found out 15 she was a man so they fired her. She had a lawsuit against the company too about that. I think 16 she finally won that and then that’s when she moved to Vegas. 17 AJ: OK. 18 BBA: But, what I really want to do, Andrea, is go back to work, go work out at the gym, save some 19 money, get me a car, and travel to see Deja and the rest of my family. Like Kenaday . . . 20 AJ: Like who? 21 BBA: Kenaday. 22 AJ: Kenaday? I don’t remember . . . 23 BBA: You don’t remember Kenaday Williams, she used to be up here from Houston, Texas. 24 AJ: I don’t think I remember Kenaday. 25 BBA: She used to be with me and Deja all the time. 26 AJ: Really? OK. 27 BBA: Me and Deja went out five years straight - every night for five years straight. 28 AJ: Every night? Seven days a week? 29 BBA: Every night. Yes, every day of the week for five years straight. 30 AJ: Wow. Breatta Bee Amore 14 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota BBA: After that, then that’s when she moved to Las Vegas. That’s why I’m missing 1 her – a lot of grand 2 times with her. 3 AJ: I know, I loved Deja. 4 BBA: Every night. 5 AJ: I miss her so much. 6 BBA: The Saloon every night, Exchange every night, Brass Rail every night. We loved it, I just loved it. 7 AJ: So, let me ask you a personal question, Bee, and you don’t have to answer it – only if you want 8 to, but are you HIV positive? 9 BBA: I have full-blown AIDS and I’ve been living with it since 1993. 10 AJ: Really? 11 BBA: Yes. 12 AJ: That’s a long time. 13 BBA: The reason why I’m living with it is, still living, is because the doctor says I’m non-detectable and 14 everything and I’ve taken a low dose of medicine for the last 15 years now. 15 AJ: Is that right? 16 BBA: Yeah. 17 AJ: Wow. Man, AZT . . . is that . . .? 18 BBA: No, they don’t have that no more. That killed my friend, Eric – that killed Eric. They had that – 19 that was the first drug for AIDS and HIV, but it was still killing people. 20 AJ: Wow. What kind of medication do you take? 21 BBA: They’ve got very advanced new drugs now and I take six regiments of AIDS medicine and two of 22 them are in one pill and four of them in one pill. 23 AJ: So, you only take two pills? 24 BBA: No, I take five pills – like vitamins, but those two I take every day. Every morning and if I miss it, 25 I take it in the afternoon or at night. It gives me a boost of energy. 26 AJ: Yeah, you look good. 27 BBA: Well, thank you. I try to keep myself looking good. 28 AJ: Wow, since 1993. That’s quite a long time. 29 BBA: I contracted HIV in 1990 and I went [inaudible 24:48] and then I contracted AIDS in 1993. But, 30 they started me on medicine when I was HIV-positive too and they said that helped a lot too. 31 AJ: Right. So, if your viral loads are undetectable, does that still mean you have full-blown AIDS? Breatta Bee Amore 15 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota BBA: Yes, it just can’t be spread as quick anymore. That’s the benefit, it can’t 1 spread as fast. 2 AJ: How do you think the impact of being Black, being transgender, and having HIV and AIDS has 3 affected your life? 4 BBA: Well, my life has been . . . since I found out I had this, up and down. [inaudible 25:48] 5 AJ: Can I ask you to just speak a little bit louder. 6 BBA: OK. My life has been like an up and down battle since I found out I have this. Back about 15 7 years ago, I was on street drugs every day, that didn’t help me out any. That brought me further 8 down. 9 AJ: When you say street drugs, you mean like cocaine and . . . 10 BBA: Yeah, cocaine and acid and pills. But, I’ve been clean and sober since 2003. 11 AJ: Nice. 12 BBA: That life didn’t help me at all. 13 AJ: Right. Has it affected your ability to find work? 14 BBA: No, it hasn’t done that – they all know I’m a transsexual. All my jobs I had, I would tell them I 15 was transsexual. 16 AJ: OK. 17 BBA: There wasn’t no problem because of that. It was my . . . I’m not sure it helped when I got sick 18 and I called in. 19 AJ: You’re sick, yeah. And then you would lose your job? 20 BBA: Well, my one job kept me for many years – I worked that job for five years. I got sick and I was 21 in the hospital for a week and that job paid me for being out that week too. 22 AJ: Wow. 23 BBA: I had no problem with employment here in Minneapolis. 24 AJ: What kind of work did you do? 25 BBA: Well, I do computer work, I worked in a NutraSweet plant. 26 AJ: In a which kind of plant? 27 BBA: NutraSweet – sugar. 28 AJ: Oh, NutraSweet.

I was raised well - I was raised very well. I was 21 raised good by my mom and my grandmother. Now, the reason why I talk about my 22 grandmother more than anyone else is because she was my heart. I miss her, but I still know 23 she’s looking over me and everything. When I was coming up with her, it was a wonderful 24 experience. 25 AJ: Is your mom still alive? 26 BBA: No, all my parents and grandparents are gone now. The only ones from my immediate family 27 are me and my two brothers. 28 AJ: Really? Did your mom or your dad know that you were transgender? 29 BBA: Yeah, my mom did; my dad didn’t – my dad was long dead when I . . . 30 AJ: When you came out. Breatta Bee Amore 17 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota BBA: No, when I came out . . . he knew when 1 I came out . . . 2 AJ: As gay, but not as a woman. 3 BBA: Not as a woman, no. He didn’t know [inaudible 29:45]. 4 AJ: So, did your brothers and sisters . . . they know. 5 BBA: Yeah, they know. 6 AJ: Do you guys still talk? Do you guys get along? 7 BBA: Yeah, my brothers and sisters love me. 8 AJ: Really? 9 BBA: Yeah, they like the way I am. 10 AJ: Yeah, I love it – that’s beautiful. 11 BBA: They like it too. I went home for the first time as a trans woman in 2012. I didn’t think I would 12 be accepted as well as I thought I was. My cousin, my female cousin, Joyce, I walked in the 13 house and she said, “Oh, my goodness – whoa, you looking fine. You must have a good life up 14 there in Minnesota the way you’re looking girl.” My middle cousin said, “You look more like a 15 woman than you ever did.” “Oh, shit.” And my brother, he said that too. I look like my mama 16 and he said, “Damn, you look exactly like our mama now.” Crazy boy. “You look like mama 17 now,” he tells me. 18 AJ: Oh, wow. 19 BBA: I love my family. 20 AJ: That’s good. 21 BBA: I got some that don’t accept the way I am, they’re church-going people . . . deacons, you know, 22 but I can understand where they’re coming from, they’re living for the Lord. I believe in God, I 23 always have. Just because I’m a trans don’t mean . . . 24 AJ: Right. Do you go to church now? 25 BBA: Oh, yeah, I still go to church. I’m going to church this Sunday. There’s a church right here in 26 Richfield here that I go to, it’s called East Side Baptist Church, it’s on 62nd and Oliver. 27 AJ: East Side Baptist Church. 28 BBA: 62nd and Oliver – you know where the freeway is? 29 AJ: Yeah. 30 BBA: That’s the street behind the freeway, the church is right behind the freeway over there. 31 AJ: Really? 32 BBA: You can park right there by the freeway fence too. Breatta Bee Amore 18 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: I know, I’ve 1 been around there. 2 BBA: There’s the church parking lot. 3 AJ: And the people at the church are pretty nice to you? 4 BBA: Yeah, they’re crazy about me. I love people. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have no friends. 5 AJ: Right. 6 BBA: I love good people – people with heart and soul. 7 AJ: Wow. So, do the police harass you for being transgender? 8 BBA: No. Do you know what happened to me? We went to see Patty LaBelle on the 14th of last 9 month. I was dressed as a woman and I had to go to the bathroom. 10 AJ: Right. 11 BBA: So, one of the people that worked there, I went downstairs and I went in the women’s 12 bathroom and she told me I couldn’t do in there. I said, “I’m here dressed as a woman, I’m 13 going to the woman’s bathroom. If I go in the men’s bathroom, they’re going to wonder why 14 I’m in there and they’re going to harass me.” So, that’s why I went to the women’s bathroom – 15 to avoid all the harassment, and they find out I’m a guy I might get killed by somebody in the 16 bathroom. 17 AJ: Right, exactly. 18 BBA: Men are very, very suspicious. 19 AJ: Was this at a casino? 20 BBA: No, this was at the State Theatre. 21 AJ: Oh, downtown at the State Theatre. OK. 22 BBA: She was talking so loud while I was going to the bathroom and the police came to the top of the 23 stairs and waited until I came back upstairs. He didn’t say two words to me because he thought 24 I was a real girl. 25 AJ: Yeah. So, no real harassment. 26 BBA: I used to get harassed when I first started transitioning, but see Deja helped me come out of 27 that. “What are people going to say? They’re going to say it anyway, you’re going to keep on 28 living and breathing.” That’s what Deja taught me. 29 AJ: So, Deja is like your mentor? Your sister? 30 BBA: She was a good . . . she is a sister to me and I miss her so much. It’s like I said, if I ever get my 31 stuff together, get my car, take the transfer all over from New York to LA, then I’ll go see her. 32 AJ: Wow. So, can I ask you this question – and again, only answer it to the extent that you feel 33 comfortable, but have you done any medical things as a part of your transition? Breatta Bee Amore 19 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota BBA: No, I’m working 1 on that right now. 2 AJ: OK, really? 3 BBA: I’m on a lot of hormones. 4 AJ: You’re on hormones, OK. 5 BBA: Dr. Deborah Thorpe at Park Nicollet Clinic, she got me on six hormone . . . 6 AJ: Dr. Deborah Thorpe. What’s the name of her clinic? 7 BBA: Park Nicollet. 8 AJ: Park Nicollet – yeah, yeah, yeah. 9 BBA: Yeah, Park Nicollet and she’s got me on six hormones now. I started with two and went all the 10 way up to six. I feel great. 11 AJ: You feel good. 12 BBA: Feel great. 13 AJ: Have you had, or are you thinking about having any surgeries at all? 14 BBA: Yeah, I think about it. 15 AJ: Yeah, cool. Looking back on your decision to express your true gender identity, Bee, would you 16 do it all over again? 17 BBA: Yes, I would. I would do it over again and even better. 18 AJ: Even better. 19 BBA: Even better, I would. I had so much fun doing it with Deja. It’s good to do it with somebody, 20 especially another transgender person that you can call a friend, that made it seem like it was so 21 much smoother and easier to come out being with her. 22 AJ: What about relationships? Are you in a relationship? 23 BBA: Well, I have had a few relationships. I had one relationship when Deja was living with me and I 24 had a guy named, Gary, living with me. 25 AJ: So, David? 26 BBA: No, his name was Gary. 27 AJ: Gary, OK. 28 BBA: He lived with me and Deja when I had my apartment. OK, this guy would come and tell me Deja 29 was hitting on him and Deja would come tell me he was hitting on her. So, I put them both out. 30 I put them out and I ain’t seen Gary . . . he tried to break my door down to get his clothes, but 31 he came back with the police and got them. And then Deja moved in with Richard, Richard 32 Judge. Breatta Bee Amore 20 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: Yeah, Richard – another good friend of ours. 1 Richard Judge. 2 BBA: Yeah, he’s doing good I heard too. 3 AJ: Yeah, he is. 4 BBA: I was always crazy for him. Do you know Gus and Larkin? 5 AJ: What’s his name? 6 BBA: Gus and Larkin – do you know them two? 7 AJ: Gus and Larkin? I don’t know those two. 8 BBA: You might know who Gus is, he’s from Chicago. 9 AJ: I might. 10 BBA: Gus is from Chicago and Larkin is from here and they used to live . . . they used to give after 11 parties on Franklin and . . . was it Clinton? Yeah, Clinton and Franklin. 12 AJ: OK. 13 BBA: They’d have after parties there, after the bar closed. 14 AJ: Right. 15 BBA: They’d charge $2 or $3 to get in . . . 16 AJ: To get in . . . 17 BBA: Buy your drinks and food and party all night. 18 AJ: Drinks and food and have fun all night. Are you in a relationship now? 19 BBA: No, not now. I’m waiting to get my dentures. 20 AJ: OK. 21 BBA: I had all my teeth pulled out and I’m getting dentures pretty soon here. 22 AJ: Pretty soon. 23 BBA: So, I’m definitely going to get my teeth and then go on a manhunt. 24 AJ: So, do you date men? Women? 25 BBA: No, I date men, I don’t date women. I’ll go out with women and have fun with them, but no 26 dating, no sex with women – none of that. 27 AJ: None of that. 28 BBA: Nope, none of that, Andrea. 29 AJ: Wow. Breatta Bee Amore 21 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota BBA: 1 Wait, Andrea. OK. 2 AJ: So, Bee, do you ever think about . . . and I know you’ve identified as gay in the past, what do you 3 think the relationship is between the gay community and the trans community? 4 BBA: Well, I think I see similarities but gays, gay people, don’t dress as girls – they dress as guys. They 5 look like girls but they [inaudible 38:42]. I understand that life, I lived it. It was fun doing that 6 too. 7 AJ: Right. 8 BBA: I had my two best friends from doing that with. 9 AJ: Yup – Eric and Ed. 10 BBA: Right. We were real butch bunnies in Chicago and I loved it – just loved it. It happened in the 11 1970s, you can just imagine how much fun we had those years. 12 AJ: In the 1970s, exactly. 13 BBA: Dancing every night. 14 (pause) 15 AJ: All right, Bee, I am loving this conversation. It’s so good to get to know you a little bit better. 16 BBA: It’s better to get to know you too. I always thought you were one awesome person. 17 AJ: Well, thank you so, so much. I really appreciate it. So, Bee, when you think about being 18 transgender, what are some of the most challenging parts for you? 19 BBA: The most challenging part is when I go somewhere by myself, I hope people wouldn’t try to hurt 20 me or harass me or . . . you know, like a drive by to me or anything. It’s very dangerous. 21 AJ: That happens to a lot of young transgender girls. 22 BBA: I’ve heard a lot about it and I’ve seen it happen in Chicago before, many times. I’ve been trying 23 to stay on the straight and narrow and not mess with the wrong crowd and get in trouble. I’m 24 all about that. I want to live my life and grow old – grow old gracefully, not recklessly. 25 AJ: Yes, exactly. So, that’s one concern – are there other things that you worry about or think 26 about? 27 BBA: Yeah, I worry a lot about my family, my friends – like you, I think about you a lot, Deja a lot. 28 Girlfriends, all the good people . . . you’re one of the good ones, Andrea. I think about you, I 29 know you’re doing good and you’re looking good. 30 AJ: I’m doing OK, I’m doing OK. 31 BBA: Sometimes when I’d go to that group at the Exchange, I kind of miss not being there. 32 AJ: Really? So, there’s a group at the Exchange. Tell me about it. Breatta Bee Amore 22 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota BBA: OK, the Exchange is a wonderful place for transsexuals to go to. Now we have 1 two up here – the 2 Union and the Exchange. 3 AJ: And the Exchange, which is at 34th and Chicago, right? 4 BBA: Yeah, SouthSide. 5 AJ: It’s part of Café SouthSide. 6 BBA: Yeah, it’s part of Café SouthSide. There used to be a thrift store upstairs but that’s moved out 7 now. The Exchange is still downstairs. 8 AJ: So, the group is all transgender people? Men and women? 9 BBA: Men and women, yes. They take all. I have met a trans girl named Max. 10 AJ: Max? 11 BBA: She used to be a girl. Now, there’s another one that comes there, she’s got a full beard. 12 AJ: Oh, wow. 13 BBA: She’s on male hormones, that’s why she has a full beard on her face. 14 AJ: OK. So, she identifies as a guy? 15 BBA: Yes. [inaudible 42:46] 16 AJ: So, you should probably call her a him then. 17 BBA: Yeah, I do call her him. I call her boy – I don’t call her a woman; she don’t look like no woman, 18 she looks like a man. 19 AJ: Right. 20 BBA: I’ve got some gays in my family too, Andrea. I’m a transsexual, and there’s another one like me, 21 a drag queen – there’s two of them. 22 AJ: Oh, really? In Chicago or Milwaukee? 23 BBA: They live in Milwaukee. My cousin that’s gay in Chicago, he’s a butch bunny. 24 AJ: What’s a butch bunny. 25 BBA: A butch boy – a boy gay. He dresses like a guy, but he looks like a woman. 26 AJ: Oh, really. OK. What’s the most positive thing for you about being transgender? 27 BBA: Most positive thing is it just feels good to live your life. It feels wonderful to be me. 28 AJ: Yes. 29 BBA: I’m happy with who I am because I’ve been this way since I can remember and now that I’m 30 trans, I feel a lot more comfortable in my skin, I feel wonderful all the time. I thank the Lord for 31 raising me up and being this way. Breatta Bee Amore 23 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: I can see the joy in your face when 1 you say that. 2 BBA: Well, you know, I’m just blessed. Every day when I wake up, Andrea, there’s three things I do. 3 When I first get out of bed, I dropped to my knees and pray that things will pick me up. I read a 4 verse in my Bible and I read a verse in my AA manual. 5 AJ: In your . . .? 6 BBA: AA manual – yeah, you know, Alcoholics Anonymous . . . I read a verse in that and my Bible and 7 then I pray. 8 AJ: Wow. 9 BBA: And my day works out a lot better if I do that. 10 AJ: Gratitude, right? You’ve got to be grateful, thankful. 11 BBA: Yeah, that’s true. 12 AJ: Bee, the last question. So, when you think about the transgender community, what do you 13 think it’s going to be like for transgender people 50 years from now? 14 BBA: It’s going to be awesome. Andrea, I think it’s going to be skyrocketing to the heavens, that’s 15 what I think about the transgender life. It’s wonderful to be this way – as long as you’re not 16 conniving and scheming, you want to live on a positive note with what you are and make 17 yourself a better person. 18 AJ: Do you think transgender people are going to be more accepted and be able to get jobs and be 19 able to get their own house and be able to get access to health care. 20 BBA: I think in the next 50 years, Andrea, they should be equal with any other person. 21 AJ: There you go. Full equality. 22 BBA: Housing, adopt kids . . . 23 AJ: Getting married. 24 BBA: Yeah, getting married – if that’s your choice. 25 AJ: If that’s your choice. 26 BBA: I almost got married to my partner. 27 AJ: Really? 28 BBA: I broke it off because he was an alcoholic. What happened, I was with my partner, my last one, 29 for 15 years and we were going to get married but he started drinking. I was watching on 30 television and I seen these two African kids – the little girl was 7 and the little boy was 2. When 31 they showed those commercials on the television, the African boy was asleep and when he 32 woke up his whole family was dead except him. He had to run to another village, to his aunt – 33 he ran and [inaudible 46:10]. Now, the little girl, she was 7. She wasn’t home when all her 34 family got killed in a tent. When she went home and found them dead, she ran to another Breatta Bee Amore 24 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota country to her aunt’s house – another country, I was like, “Oh, that little girl 1 gone, she ran to 2 another country.” She didn’t have nothing but her thin gown on her. 3 AJ: Little nightgown. 4 BBA: She had a nightgown on, it was white and you could see right through it. I wanted to adopt 5 those two kids but my partner was drinking so much and I didn’t want no kids being subjected to 6 being around an alcoholic on top of everything else, the marriage and the adoption of kids. 7 AJ: Oh, boy. Bee, is there anything that I did not ask you that you really want people to know about 8 you, about your life, about being transgender, about living with HIV/AIDS, about being Black? 9 Anything that you . . . 10 BBA: Yeah, that’s probably [inaudible 47:26] being Black and transgender. That [inaudible 47:48] I am 11 Black and transgender. 12 AJ: Right. 13 BBA: But, when I go out in public, I don’t get no harassment like I used to. They just think I’m a 14 female. 15 AJ: When you’re in public – yeah. 16 BBA: They think I’m a girl, so I I’m going to let them think that – I want them to think that anyway. 17 AJ: Wow. 18 BBA: It’s been a wonderful experience for me. 19 AJ: That’s wonderful. I’m so happy to hear that, Bee – I really am. Well, listen, I thank you so much 20 for sharing this time with me and sharing yourself with everybody. 21 BBA: Anytime – I’ll tell you more, girl. I’ll tell you about all my family and all the years I traveled 22 around the world twice – everything. I mean, being gay and since I came out, it’s just been a 23 wonderful life. 24 AJ: Thank you. All right, dear. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye. 25 BBA: Bye-bye, darling.
