We do, uh, gallery submission. 41 42 AJ: Mhm. 43 44 MB: Uhm, there’s puppetry [laughs], comedians, uh, variety show, workshops. 45 46 AJ: Is it a multiple day event? 47 Micky Bradford Interview 20 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 MB: Oh yeah. 2 3 AJ: Mhm. 4 5 MB: It’s a weeklong thing. 6 7 AJ: Oh, it’s a week long. 8 9 MB: It’s a weeklong thing. It takes a lot of energy, a lot of people. 10 11 AJ: Right. Wow. Yeah. That is organizing. 12 13 MB: [Laughs]. 14 15 AJ: Uhm, what’s the importance for organizing around art in your opinion? 16 17 MB: It’s necessary. I, I don’t think that we can have actual movements without art. I don’t think that 18 we can have conversations, uhm, about actually how these issues affect us. 19 20 AJ: Mhm. 21 22 MB: Like, in our bodies, in our hearts, in our families, in our emotions, in our spirits. Like we can’t 23 have those conversations… 24 25 AJ: Right. 26 27 MB: … as deeply without art as a medium to actually bare the soul and actually be vulnerable. 28 29 AJ: Mhm. Wow, that’s beautiful. Uhm… 30 31 MB: Otherwise everything is so surface level and theory and nah. 32 33 AJ: And so what’s your artistic expression? 34 35 MB: I’m a performance artist. 36 37 AJ: Yeah. [Laughs]. 38 39 MB: I did this one performance, uhm, it was in like drag, uhm, where I had this film playing on the 40 screen in the back of me… 41 42 AJ: Mhm, mhm. 43 44 MB: … while I’m dancin’. 45 46 AJ: Right. 47 Micky Bradford Interview 21 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MB: Sade’s Is it a 1 Crime is playing. 2 3 AJ: [Singing] Is it a crime? 4 5 MB: Yes, exactly. And it’s a whole piece around, uhm, the fetishization and criminalization of black 6 queer folks, black trans folks. 7 8 AJ: Right. 9 10 MB: Uhm, and so I have white people come up and lick chocolate off of me. 11 12 AJ: Oh. Oh, interesting. 13 14 MB: Yes. And at a certain point in the performance they realize, “Oh, this is bad. I’m not supposed, 15 this is racist. Oh, my god, I’m participating in racism.” And I’m just living it up, of course. 16 17 AJ: Right. 18 19 MB: And then the black people are getting like, “Oh, my god I love this.” [Laughs]. You’re 20 embarrassing all of them. 21 22 AJ: Wow. Exactly. 23 24 MB: So that’s my work. 25 26 AJ: You’re a little sticky but it was worth it I would take it. 27 28 MB: Oh absolutely. I love to be naked. 29 30 AJ: [Laughs]. 31 32 MB: And fucking have things all over my body, oh my god yes. 33 34 AJ: Wow. That’s incredible. 35 36 MB: [Laughs]. 37 38 AJ: Uhm… 39 40 MB: Thank you. 41 42 AJ: So, uhm, what kind of challenges have you personally faced since you’ve come out as a trans…? 43 44 MB: Oh, god. 45 46 AJ: … a queer trans woman? 47 Micky Bradford Interview 22 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MB: Right.

It’s just the, the anxiety, the depression, all of it, uhm, I think has been 32 real isolating, and it makes it hard to, to speak sometimes. It makes it hard to believe in your 33 voice and the power of your voice and the validity of, of your voice, uhm, of my voice. 34 35 AJ: Right. 36 37 MB: Yeah. I think it’s been hard to, to love myself. To actually be like, “Oh, this body is fine. This body 38 is lovely.” 39 40 AJ: Are you getting closer to that? 41 42 MB: Absolutely. Everyday. [Laughs]. I mean, honestly, I used to be that kid that was just like super, 43 super angry all the time… 44 45 AJ: Right. 46 Micky Bradford Interview 23 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MB: Uhm, did not know what to do with that shit.

[Laughs]. 5 6 MB: Uhm, and I don’t have… 7 8 AJ: And now you’re like the most joyful person ever. 9 10 MB: [Laughs]. I’m not the most joyful person ever. 11 12 AJ: Maybe not the most joyful person ever but I’ve experienced you as joyful in our interactions 13 together. Thoughtful and, uhm, certainly sort of like appropriately in whatever the situation is, 14 whether it’s a deep serious conversation or just with the children, I mean, but there’s always a 15 joyfulness, and maybe, maybe it’s your youthfulness that, uh… 16 17 MB: [Laughs]. 18 19 AJ: … that sort of facilitates some of that but, uhm… 20 21 MB: [Laughs]. Fifty, fifty. 22 23 AJ: … it’s a beautiful thing to be around you and, and it comes off on other people… 24 25 MB: Cute. 26 27 AJ: … or at least me anyways. Yeah, so, uhm… 28 29 MB: That’s my work though is to bring joy… 30 31 AJ: Mhm. 32 33 MB: … is just to always try to see things better than they are. I mean that’s the social justice work. 34 That shit is depressing and thankless. 35 36 AJ: It’s hard. It’s very hard work. It’s thankless as, as fuck. 37 38 MB: [Laughs]. 39 40 AJ: It’s thankless as fuck. Like, nobody sees you, uh, ever. 41 42 MB: And we are not getting paid. 43 44 AJ: Unless you are superbly, beautifully, uh, [laughs], trans. 45 46 MB: Mm. 47 Micky Bradford Interview 24 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: [Laughs]. And, you know, and not to say that we aren’t beautiful but we, I don’t 1 meet the sort of 2 standards of beauty that others have deemed acceptable. 3 4 MB: Or as like to be lifted up as an example of black transness. 5 6 AJ: Right. Exactly. And so consequently, uhm, that’s a thing. But speaking of joy what are the joys 7 that you’ve experienced since coming out as QTW. 8 9 MB: QTW. Queer trans woman. [Laughs]. I’m gonna take that down. Put that on my HER account. 10 [Laughs]. 11 12 AJ: Right. 13 14 MB: [Laughs]. 15 16 AJ: Which account? 17 18 MB: HER. The lesbian dating app. 19 20 AJ: Oh, okay. 21 22 MB: It’s where to find lesbians. [Laughs]. I’ll put that in there. Uhm, shit, the joy, the fucking joy is 23 being in this damn community. 24 25 AJ: Mhm. 26 27 MB: Like I have never not been grateful for the fucking people that I have met in these years, uhm… 28 29 AJ: Wow. 30 31 MB: I wish, sorry [Tearing up]. 32 33 AJ: It’s okay. 34 35 MB: Uhm, yeah, people have really showed up for me… 36 37 AJ: Yeah? 38 39 MB: … across the years, people have really fucking showed up for me from the time when I... Before I 40 even knew… 41 42 AJ: Uhuh. 43 44 MB: … about my gender or my sexuality or was even kinda going through… 45 46 AJ: Right. 47 Micky Bradford Interview 25 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MB: … exploring 1 those, uhm… 2 3 AJ: Mhm. 4 5 MB: I mean, my fucking [laughs] non-black tiq uando instructors were like some of the first people 6 to… 7 8 AJ: Really. 9 10 MB: … actually just be like, “You’re okay, you little weirdo.” 11 12 AJ: Awe. [Laughs]. 13 14 MB: “We gonna take you to Dragoncon and we’re gonna talk to you about some gay shit.” 15 16 AJ: [Laughs]. Wow. 17 18 MB: “Even though you haven’t told us, but we’re gonna talk to you about this cause we know you 19 wanna talk about gay shit.” 20 21 AJ: Right. 22 23 MB: They were so fucking cool. 24 25 AJ: Ah. 26 27 MB: And from like, that was me, god, fifteen, sixteen… 28 29 AJ: Mhm, mhm. 30 31 MB: … I was taking tiquando. 32 33 AJ: Right. 34 35 MB: Uhm, up until, I’m twenty-six now, and folks are still showing up for me just in the most amazing 36 ways. 37 38 AJ: Wow. 39 40 MB: And just, yeah.

Mhm. 25 26 MB: And one day be able to somewhat pass. [Laughs]. 27 28 AJ: I don’t think that’s your problem but… [Laughs]. 29 30 MB: Yeah, no I’m, yeah. It’s, it’s definitely in the near future for me as well. 31 32 AJ: Hormones or... 33 34 MB: Absolutely. I love hormones. 35 36 AJ: Okay. 37 38 MB: I love hormones. 39 40 AJ: But you’re on hormones then? 41 42 MB: Yes. 43 44 AJ: Okay. Alright. Cool. And they’re giving you the desired effects? [Laughs]. 45 46 MB: Yeah, yeah, yeah, they’re coming through. 47 Micky Bradford Interview 27 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: Yeah, it’s coming through 1 this moment. [Laughs]. 2 3 MB: [Laughs]. She’s doing what she’s supposed to. 4 5 AJ: Do what you do, baby girl. [Laughs]. 6 7 MB: Yeah. But I am, yeah, I’m weighing my options around surgery and things like that. 8 9 AJ: Uhuh. 10 11 MB: I don’t think right now that I want FFS, facial feminization surgery. 12 13 AJ: Right. 14 15 MB: Uhm, I just wanna, I remember there was a… I can’t remember when but it was an interview 16 that Amiyah Scott gave… 17 18 AJ: Uhuh. 19 20 MB: … where she said, uhm… 21 22 AJ: Amiyah. 23 24 MB: Amiyah. 25 26 AJ: Uhuh. 27 28 MB: … where she said give your body five years. Like just five years on hormones. 29 30 AJ: Mhm. 31 32 MB: If you can do that and you can actually see yourself like… 33 34 AJ: Sure. 35 36 MB: … in your actual body as it is. 37 38 AJ: Uhuh. 39 40 MB: Uhm, then you can start to make more decisions about what surgical options and other things. 41 42 AJ: Mhm. 43 44 MB: And I was like that feels right for me. I just wanna be at home in my body. 45 46 AJ: Right. 47 Micky Bradford Interview 28 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MB: Uhm, and I want to see what this 1 body is capable of. 2 3 AJ: Mhm. 4 5 MB: You know, with a different balance of hormones. 6 7 AJ: That’s, that’s, that’s a good, uhm, good advice. I mean, you know, it’s one way of thinking about 8 it. 9 10 MB: Yeah. 11 12 AJ: I’m sure other people have other ideas but, uhm, no, uhm, so I’m just gonna switch gears a little 13 bit cause you talked about… 14 15 MB: Switch it up. 16 17 AJ: … Southern Fried… 18 19 MB: Queer Pride. 20 21 AJ: Queer Pride. 22 23 MB: Yes. 24 25 AJ: Uh, but I know you also do some other work too for the Transgender Law Center. 26 27 MB: I do. I’ve been working for the Transgender Law Center for the last… almost three years. 28 29 AJ: Mhm. 30 31 MB: Uhm. 32 33 AJ: In partnership with SONG? 34 35 MB: With Southerners on New Ground. 36 37 AJ: Yes. [Laughs]. 38 39 MB: Give it to it. Twenty-five years of organizing and sass. [Laughs]. 40 41 AJ: Wooh. Absolutely. Would a strong, queer, and trans, uh… 42 43 MB: Feminist. 44 45 AJ: … feminist analysis around the intersectional work that you guys do? So tell me a little bit about 46 that work. 47 Micky Bradford Interview 29 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MB: Yeah, my work, uhm, in the last three years has mostly been, uhm, about going 1 on this listening 2 tour at the south… 3 4 AJ: Mhm. 5 6 MB: … and really trying to understand what are the conditions, uhm, not just the conditions that 7 people are under… 8 9 AJ: Mhm. 10 11 MB: … in different southern towns and cities but what, what are the ways in which people are 12 practicing resilience? 13 14 AJ: Right. 15 16 MB: What are the new strategies that are emerging? What are the, the bleeding points in terms of 17 jails, immigration, uhm, public health… 18 19 AJ: Mhm. 20 21 MB: … uhm, criminalization, right, of so many things: behavior, HIV, all the things. What are those 22 bleeding points and where do people actually want to build power, right? Where do people 23 want to come together and, and actually build a campaign to actually win some shit? 24 25 AJ: Mhm. 26 27 MB: Not just policy, not just a fucking reform but literally how do we want to come together to 28 change hearts and minds… 29 30 AJ: Right. 31 32 MB: … across like all of these similar, very similar towns. 33 34 AJ: Mhm. 35 36 MB: Yeah. 37 38 AJ: Wow, that’s amazing. 39 40 MB: Yeah. 41 42 AJ: That’s amazing. It is draining. I would, I’m not even imagining cause I do a lot of that kind of 43 work and so I know that it can be depleting and but by the end of the day it’s really, you know, 44 trying to create space and trying to, uhm, create opportunities for other trans and queer 45 communities to, to lift themselves up… 46 47 MB: Yeah. Micky Bradford Interview 30 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: … that’s positive and that’s powerful. 3 4 MB: Yeah. 5 6 AJ: Yeah. 7 8 MB: Sometimes it looks like, you know, uh, one of the only black trans women living in Fayetteville, 9 Arkansas. 10 11 AJ: Right. 12 13 MB: You know, who’s, oh gosh, how old is she? Probably like into her sixties. She’s in her sixties. 14 15 AJ: Oh my goodness. Wow. 16 17 MB: Uhm, and then having her sit down… 18 19 AJ: Talk about isolation. 20 21 MB: Right! Right? Oh gosh, have her sit down with, you know, a twenty-five-year-old black trans 22 woman… 23 24 AJ: Mhm. 25 26 MB: … uhm, and have them have intergenerational conversation about their organizing, about 27 growing up, about what their state needs, what their community needs. 28 29 AJ: Mhm. 30 31 MB: That’s the type of work that makes me happy. 32 33 AJ: Wow. 34 35 MB: That’s to type of work I like to do. 36 37 AJ: Uhuh. Wow, that’s fascinating. Uhm, have you had any challenges in healthcare or police or 38 school or institutions? How do you navigate institutions as a queer black trans woman? 39 40 MB: Oh. [Makes clicking noise with mouth]. Name some more institutions to get my mind rolling. 41 42 AJ: Yeah, uhm, the medical industry, uhm, the police department, the DMV, uh [laughs], you know, 43 colleges. Were you able to get your transcripts name changed or? 44 45 MB: Uh, I’m real lazy with that stuff to be honest. 46 47 AJ: Okay. Micky Bradford Interview 31 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MB: All my ID stuff has not been changed over yet. 3 4 AJ: Tell me about your name. Micky. 5 6 MB: [Laughs]. I chose it when I was like, what? Five, six, seven? I was seven. I was seven when I chose 7 my name. 8 9 AJ: Oh wow. 10 11 MB: Because no one could freaking pronounce my birth name which is German. 12 13 AJ: Uhuh. Okay. 14 15 MB: I’m not going to say it. 16 17 AJ: Not gonna say it, okay. 18 19 MB: Uhm, but folks can look that up or whatever. 20 21 AJ: Right. 22 23 MB: But folks cannot pronounce it when we got over to the states. 24 25 AJ: Sure. 26 27 MB: So I was like just call me Micky. 28 29 AJ: Uhuh. 30 31 MB: And Micky has been my name ever since. 32 33 AJ: So literally you don’t really have to, I mean… 34 35 MB: Nope, I’m Micky to everybody. 36 37 AJ: Yeah. 38 39 MB: And that’s gender neutral enough for me. 40 41 AJ: Yeah, absolutely. Wow. So at seven you were like, “I’m going with this.” 42 43 MB: I knew who the fuck I was. 44 45 AJ: [Laughs]. 46 47 MB: Yes. This is me. Micky Bradford Interview 32 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Wow. 3 4 MB: Call me this not that. 5 6 AJ: That’s adorable. So you’re in the game. You’re like doing this leadership work. You’re organizing 7 with one of the most venerable sort of queer people of color groups in the nation. SONG, I 8 mean. People are just bow down. 9 10 MB: [Laughs]. 11 12 AJ: What do you see as the future of the trans community? 13 14 MB: Oh wow. That’s broad. 15 16 AJ: The future of the trans and gender non-conforming community, I should say. 17 18 MB: Uhm, in terms of what? [Laughs]. 19 20 AJ: Uhm, in terms of access. In terms of growth and development. In terms of, uhm, what are the 21 political structures within the community that are around to support that kind of growth like, 22 uhm, I mean, so TLC is one of those. 23 24 MB: Right. 25 26 AJ: The Transgender Law Center is one of the pillars that is sort of helping to sustain and, uhm, 27 breathe life into the movement. [Laughs]. If you will. There’s organizations like TWOC, Trans 28 Women of Color Collective and so, it, my question is, you know, given the fact that we’re now in 29 an age where trans organizing and trans lib organizations are real… 30 31 MB: Mhm. 32 33 AJ: … and functioning. Uhm, what, what should our agenda be and, and where are we going in the 34 future? 35 36 MB: [Sighs]. Okay, so, couple of things. I want to name that I feel like we’re moving from what I saw 37 as a movement, uhm, of leaders, uhm, where we have a model where you are a trans leader 38 over here. You’re a trans leader over here in this place. You’re a trans leader over. We’re gonna 39 bring all of y’all together… 40 41 AJ: Mhm. 42 43 MB: … and then we’re going to give you resources. We’re going to train you. We’re going to send you 44 to places, and we’re going to try to support your growth, your leadership, your organizations 45 that you started, your community groups. 46 47 AJ: Right. Micky Bradford Interview 33 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MB: Uhm, and I think that also fits in line with a particular identity politic that folks are trying to 3 understand where they’re like, “This is my identity. I’m a trans woman, and my relationship is 4 this to cis women. My relationship is this to GNC people, and my relationship is this to other 5 trans women, right?” 6 7 AJ: Mhm, mhm. 8 9 MB: Uhm, and I think that’s dope. And it also doesn’t necessarily allow us to build as strong of a 10 gender justice movement as I want. Uhm, because it’s so individualized, and it’s so like, “Well, 11 you’re a leader so we’re gonna build you up and hopefully you’ll build up other leaders.” 12 13 AJ: Right. 14 15 MB: Versus what I feel like we’re moving into now is more having a leader-full movement, right, 16 where everybody’s leadership is valued, where there are more people being brought to the 17 table, where, uhm, it’s not necessarily so much about a particular, uhm, activist but it’s actually 18 shifting to be more about organizing and base building… 19 20 AJ: Sure. 21 22 MB: … and campaigns. Uhm, and getting those specific skills and that’s a whole, it’s a whole different 23 ball game to me, uhm, to be an activist versus an organizer. And I feel like trans movement is 24 moving towards more organizing, more community building, more, uhm, popular education and 25 leadership development of all of us… 26 27 AJ: Mhm. 28 29 MB: … and moving towards an analysis that’s like actually, uh, cis women, trans women, GNC folks 30 across the spectrum actually need to all be having conversations together. We can still have 31 autonomous discussion… 32 33 AJ: Right, right. 34 35 MB: … but we’re all trying to have like more discussions and more strategies that actually build a 36 movement of gender justice because we can’t do it by ourselves. There’s absolutely no way. 37 38 AJ: There’s no way. 39 40 MB: Patriarchy is fucking huge, and it’s the oldest goddamn oppression in the world like… 41 42 AJ: Right. 43 44 MB: … we gotta, you know? 45 46 AJ: Yeah, it’s gonna take a whole group of people to bring it down. So including in coalition with cis 47 women… Micky Bradford Interview 34 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 MB: Mhm. We gotta learn how to work with them. 3 4 AJ: … black women and white women, particularly white women, cause they, they got some work to 5 do. 6 7 MB: Mhm. [Laughs]. 8 9 AJ: Uhm, wow. Great, great response Micky. Let me ask you this. And this will be our last question. 10 Uhm, how do I frame this? Well, you know, I’m just gonna give it to you. 11 12 MB: Sure. 13 14 AJ: Is there anything that I didn’t ask you that you feel compelled to be sure is a part of this 15 conversation? 16 17 MB: Oh my… [Sighs]. 18 19 AJ: You could name some names and lift up some people. You can say a prayer. You can… [Laughs]. 20 You know, I mean, whatever. There’s no, there’s no rules. 21 22 MB: I want to see a movement of joy. 23 24 AJ: Mm. 25 26 MB: I want to see a movement of hope. I want to see art that reminds us to look for the, the light 27 that comes through even when you’re looking at a brick wall. 28 29 AJ: Uhuh. 30 31 MB: And you feel like there’s no way to move past this… 32 33 AJ: Right. [Laughs]. 34 35 MB: … with a little bit of light shining through the cracks. How do we… 36 37 AJ: And there is like literally a brick wall right outside of our window. [Laughs]. 38 39 MB: [Laughs]. I got a little bit inspired. 40 41 AJ: Yes. 42 43 MB: Uhm, but that’s what I want desperately is just a movement of joy and hope. Uhm, and the 44 word is overused but resilience. 45 46 AJ: Oh, it’s, resilience is critical though. 47 Micky Bradford Interview 35 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota MB: 1 Abso-fucking-lutely. 2 3 AJ: It is anti-black, anti-trans, anti-woman. 4 5 MB: Anti-immigrant, fucking deeply rightwing, deeply about criminalizing every goddamn thing we 6 do. 7 8 AJ: Right. So I think resilience is, however overstated, it is still a, a value and a condition that we 9 must continue to, uhm, strive for. 10 11 MB: Abso-fucking-lutely. But it, it needs to show up in this like, when I say that I also mean that in 12 our, the ways in which we talk about trans movement. 13 14 AJ: Mhm. 15 16 MB: Like trans girl to trans girl… 17 18 AJ: Yes. 19 20 MB: … the joys and all of that comes through. 21 22 AJ: Mhm. 23 24 MB: Popular culture though, absolutely not. I don’t feel like there’s any type of balance, uhm, 25 conversation around who actually trans people are or what has been our movement, where 26 have we been in other movements, immigrant justice movements. Where have we been in the 27 movements against criminalization and against jails and prisons. 28 29 AJ: Mhm.
