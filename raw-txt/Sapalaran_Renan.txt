Being transgender, it’s not easy. You’ll have the discrimination. You 31 get being bullied, you know, being judged. 32 33 AJ: Mhm. 34 35 RS: I think that’s really typical if you’re a transgender. There are really incidents that you cannot 36 avoid. You’ll be discriminated sometimes. 37 38 AJ: Sure. 39 40 RS: You know, but because of that, my experiences, it made me a lot more stronger, become more 41 proud of being me. 42 43 AJ: Mhm. 44 45 RS: It’s like I’m not afraid anymore. I mean, you could throw anything about me. 46 47 AJ: Wow. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 21 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 RS: You know, you could throw anything at me, and I have myself. I have my family who have my 3 back and my husband. 4 5 AJ: Mhm. 6 7 RS: I’ve noticed that I’ve become more, uh, I’m not scared to express what I feel, you know. 8 9 AJ: Wow. That’s, that’s huge. 10 11 RS: Yeah, that’s really huge. Especially living in a Catholic country. 12 13 AJ: Uhuh. 14 15 RS: You know. 16 17 AJ: Yeah, cause they try to make you more subdued. 18 19 RS: Yes. 20 21 AJ: Not speak up. 22 23 RS: Yeah, and not speak up, you know, no laws protecting us… 24 25 AJ: Mhm. 26 27 RS: You know, and they’re forcing you… or they will, that they want you to be, and you know to 28 yourself.. 29 30 AJ: Who you are. 31 32 RS: I know myself, who I am. You don’t need to, you don’t need to preach me. 33 34 AJ: Right. 35 36 RS: You know. You can condemn me. You know, you can condemn us all you want, you know. 37 38 AJ: Mhm. 39 40 RS: But, we’re just being ourself. 41 42 AJ: Yeah. 43 44 RS: There is nothing wrong if you are transgender… 45 46 AJ: No. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 22 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota RS: … gay, 1 lesbian, you know. 2 3 AJ: No, it’s beautiful. 4 5 RS: It’s beautiful. 6 7 AJ: Mhm. 8 9 RS: You know, being different is really beautiful. 10 11 AJ: Yeah. What have been some of the challenges that you have faced since you’ve come out? I 12 mean, I know you talked about some harassment in the Philippines. They call you he… 13 14 RS: Yeah. 15 16 AJ: … sir, but have there been other challenges? 17 18 RS: The other challenges is finding a really, a job that you want, you know? Like in the Philippines I 19 want to work at the hotel. They will interview me, but they would say that, “Oh, you’re really 20 qualified for the job, but we only accept men and women.” 21 22 AJ: Really? 23 24 RS: They would really say that to you. That really hurts. 25 26 AJ: Yes. 27 28 RS: Because I talked to them, I would send, my response would be like, “Does it make me less of a 29 person that I am a transgender?” 30 31 AJ: Mhm. 32 33 RS: Or, you know, and they would say that, “It’s really our policy.” You know, that’s really the 34 challenges. That’s why, uh, we will accept you but you need to cut your hair and dress like a man 35 and stop the hormones that you are taking. We only accept man and woman in this company. 36 37 AJ: Wow. 38 39 RS: That’s really, that’s really the challenge for all the transgender in the Philippines. That’s why 40 after I tried my best to work there but I couldn’t really find a good job so I moved to Thailand. 41 42 AJ: Mhm. 43 44 RS: And they really like me there. They’re very, very happy with, because they like when you can 45 speak English… 46 47 AJ: Yeah. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 23 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 RS: … they don’t really speak English that much there… 3 4 AJ: Uhuh. 5 6 RS: … unlike the Philippines so when I applied for being a guide, a tourist guide, and it’s really my 7 dream job to do that, and I got accepted. 8 9 AJ: Cause tourists come from all over the world. 10 11 RS: All over the world. 12 13 AJ: Mhm. 14 15 RS: It’s very accepting. More tourists compared to Philippines. 16 17 AJ: Okay. 18 19 RS: You know, so. That’s why I felt like home, like my second home. I am, I can be who I want to be 20 in this country. And I had my surgeries there. And it’s like, they’re very, very open. 21 22 AJ: Wow. 23 24 RS: In our country, when you live there and you have a tattoo, they would think that, they look, they 25 see you as, they look down on you. 26 27 AJ: Really? 28 29 RS: Yeah. 30 31 AJ: Tell me about your medical interventions, if you don’t mind talking about it. Uhm… 32 33 RS: Yeah, I had my like 7 years ago I started hormones. 34 35 AJ: Mhm. 36 37 RS: Then after like 3 year, 4 years after I went to Thailand had my breast surgery. 38 39 AJ: Mhm. 40 41 RS: And then after I had my hip surgery, my hips done as well. 42 43 AJ: When you say your hips, what does that mean? 44 45 RS: It’s like they inject silicone. 46 47 AJ: Oh, okay. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 24 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 RS: I had like three sessions there. 3 4 AJ: Mhm. 5 6 RS: Yeah. 7 8 AJ: Did it make you feel more curvy? 9 10 RS: Yeah, it does. 11 12 AJ: [Laughs]. 13 14 RS: You know, cause I was thinking at that time for a long time that I need to move to the next part. 15 You know, and it’s a lot cheaper and safer there in Thailand, you know. 16 17 AJ: Yeah, wow, so are you happy with your body now? 18 19 RS: I am really happy. 20 21 AJ: Do you think you need, try for more surgeries or? 22 23 RS: I think so to, uhm, actually I talked to my husband about it, and he said, “It’s okay. You have the 24 privilege if you wanna have done here in America or, you know, if you want to go back to 25 Thailand, you can go back.” But we’ve got to wait for the green card because once, I cannot, 26 once I get out of the country… 27 28 AJ: You may not come back. 29 30 RS: I cannot come back anymore. 31 32 AJ: Yeah. Uhm, so if you had more surgery, would it be like vaginoplasty? 33 34 RS: Yeah, that’s really my, my next, my next operation that I wanted to do. 35 36 AJ: Mhm. 37 38 RS: Yeah. 39 40 AJ: Are you afraid? 41 42 RS: A little bit. I am, I am praying about it. Yeah, from time to time, you know, to guide me, and, you 43 know, spiritually, you know. And then but, you know, I’m ready emotionally. 44 45 AJ: Yeah. So you, you grew up in a Catholic country. 46 47 RS: Yeah. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 25 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: You went to Catholic schools. Are you, do you, are you a practicing Catholic person or do you 3 see yourself as a religious person? 4 5 RS: No, not that much, but I still pray. 6 7 AJ: Mhm. 8 9 RS: You know, some of my Catholic beliefs are still there. You know, but not really religiously. Like 10 here we go to the church but the Unity Church. 11 12 AJ: Oh, okay. 13 14 RS: Where they’re more accepting. 15 16 AJ: I like Unity Church. 17 18 RS: I like, it’s really, uhm, open. 19 20 AJ: Uhuh. 21 22 RS: You know, they’re very accepting. 23 24 AJ: Which one do you go to? In Bloomington or? 25 26 RS: Uh. 27 28 AJ: Golden Valley? 29 30 RS: Golden Valley. We go there. There’s a place where we always go. 31 32 AJ: Mhm. There’s good people there? 33 34 RS: Good, very welcoming. Very welcoming. Every Saturday we go.

I’m just asking. It’s not, you know, I’m not saying that you should or that you have to 6 but, you know, sometimes I know that, uhm, you know, when you’re new to a place sometimes 7 volunteering is a good way to meet people. 8 9 RS: Yeah, actually, uhm, I’m still learning to drive. That’s a problem. 10 11 AJ: Oh, okay. 12 13 RS: I really love to, in our country we don’t drive that much. 14 15 AJ: Right. 16 17 RS: We have, we have the train, bicycles, jeepney, jeepneies are our number one, our primary 18 mode, mode… 19 20 AJ: What is it? 21 22 RS: Jeepney. 23 24 AJ: Jee— oh, a taxi. 25 26 RS: Yeah but bigger. 27 28 AJ: Uhuh. 29 30 RS: That’s our mode of transportation in the Philippines. 31 32 AJ: Jeepney. 33 34 RS: Yeah, we don’t really drive. Tricycle. We have the tricycle. That’s our mode of transportation. 35 36 AJ: Right. When someone’s driving in and you’re sitting. 37 38 RS: Yeah, in Asia that’s how we are or the train. 39 40 AJ: Uhuh. 41 42 RS: You know? So when I move here it’s like another big adjustment. 43 44 AJ: Yeah. Everybody is driving. 45 46 RS: Everybody is driving in America. 16 or 17 years old, you drive a car. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 27 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Right. 2 3 RS: In our country, you know, only if you drive. 4 5 AJ: Right. 6 7 RS: Only if you can be allowed, if you can be given the chance to loan a car. 8 9 AJ: Yeah. 10 11 RS: It’s not the same in our country. 12 13 AJ: Mhm. 14 15 RS: You can loan a car, you can get credit card. We pay in cash there mostly. 16 17 AJ: Right. Yeah. 18 19 RS: So it’s really a big adjustment. 20 21 AJ: So it’s a big deal to get a car in the Philippines. 22 23 RS: It’s, it’s a big deal. 24 25 AJ: Yeah. 26 27 RS: You know, even student loan. 28 29 AJ: Mhm. 30 31 RS: You know, you’ll be the one to go to the banks and ask.

And like this coming Saturday we’re going to do some, uhm, Thai culture 19 presentation, modeling at the Mall of America. 20 21 AJ: Oh really? 22 23 RS: Yeah.

And they’re more democrat, liberal here. 18 19 AJ: Yeah, it’s very conservative in Phoenix. 20 21 RS: Very conservative in Phoenix, you know, so it’s like I have to think about it. 22 23 AJ: Yeah.

They were asking me the question, his nephew, “Why didn’t you 4 get married in Philippines?” 5 6 AJ: Mhm. 7 8 RS: So I answered that. We live in a Catholic country. Same sex marriage will not really be 9 acknowledged. They were like [give dumbfounded look]. It puzzled them. 10 11 AJ: Yeah, cause they’re like, you’re not… 12 13 RS: I’m like, “I’m a transgender.” “Oh, yeah, yeah,” you know, “You are.” And the wife said, “You’re 14 a transgender?” “Yeah, I’m a transgender. That’s why we cannot get married in our country.” 15 16 AJ: Mhm. 17 18 RS: We cannot apply for a spousal visa in the Philippines, you know. He needs to petition here in 19 America. I can’t get a visa there. And they were like, “Oh, okay.” And I explained to them. 20 21 AJ: Mhm. So like your family now, your mom, your dad, I know you said you have struggles with 22 your mom. 23 24 RS: Yeah. 25 26 AJ: Where is it now? 27 28 RS: Oh, they’re very happy, actually, uhm, like, uhm, before I had my surgery, she bought me 29 makeup. 30 31 AJ: Yeah. 32 33 RS: You know, she called me she, daughter. 34 35 AJ: Wow. Okay. That’s good. That makes you smile. 36 37 RS: That makes me smile. And it takes, it will really take some time for the parents to accept.

It’s not the same as a passport where you can go where ever you want. You just show 19 your passport. 20 21 AJ: Right. 22 23 RS: It’s different when you live in a third world country, you know. 24 25 AJ: Mhm. 26 27 RS: So you need to apply for a… maybe after two years I can petition them to come here for a visit. 28 29 AJ: Sure. 30 31 RS: Yeah. 32 33 AJ: Uhm, did you have a big wedding? 34 35 RS: Just simple, but I had a gown, I wear my gown. 36 37 AJ: Uhuh. 38 39 RS: And, uh, we had, uh, we only had two, uhm, because we’re still adjusting, we’re new here.

Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 35 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 RS: No time to plan. I only have like 90 days or else you get sent back home. 3 4 AJ: Mhm. 5 6 RS: So we really rushed the wedding like that. You know, but I still wear my gown. 7 8 AJ: I wish I could get a picture. Send me a picture of you and your husband. 9 10 RS: Yeah. I’m going to. I’m going to send that to you. Yeah. It’s really my, it really made me cry cause 11 in my country I cannot have, I cannot, it’s not acknowledged. 12 13 AJ: Right. 14 15 RS: You cannot have this. But here I can have my gender marker changed. 16 17 AJ: Mhm. 18 19 RS: I can have my name changed? 20 21 AJ: Have you done all of those things yet? 22 23 RS: We’re still waiting for the green card. 24 25 AJ: Okay. 26 27 RS: Once it’s all settled. 28 29 AJ: Then you can make those changes. 30 31 RS: Yeah, it’s really like a dream come true because in my country, I cannot do that. 32 33 AJ: Mhm. 34 35 RS: You know. So it’s like, oh, really, I still feel lucky that I’m in America. 36 37 AJ: I remember talking to Jena, and she was saying she moved to, uhm, San Francisco. She was able 38 to get a driver’s license. 39 40 RS: Yes. 41 42 AJ: And, uhm, you know, she… 43 44 RS: And her gender marker changed. 45 46 AJ: Right.

Uhm, very famous model. 4 5 RS: Yeah. 6 7 AJ: Uh, but, she couldn’t work until she got all of that kind of taken care of. 8 9 RS: Yeah. It really takes some time, especially when you move here this way. Uhm, the lawyer told 10 us that, uh, we just have to wait because it’s really taking some time because of the government 11 right now. You know, but we called immigration, and they would say that it’s being processed so 12 we just have to wait. 13 14 AJ: Yeah. Good. I hope everything works out. 15 16 RS: I hope so too. 17 18 AJ: Yeah. Uhm, when’s the first time you ever met another transgender person? 19 20 RS: In the Philippines or here? 21 22 AJ: Any. Anywhere. First time you ever met. 23 24 RS: Oh, I was, we were at the salon and my mom was having her hair and nails done. Then I saw 25 transgender, uh, taking care of her. And I was just looking at her, and she’s really feminine 26 because, you know, she’s taking hormones. 27 28 AJ: Right. 29 30 RS: And I was like, oh my god, that really inspires me. 31 32 AJ: Yeah. 33 34 RS: It opened my eyes. When I grow up I wanna be like her. 35 36 AJ: Uhuh. 37 38 RS: I wanna grow my hair long. 39 40 AJ: Right. 41 42 RS: And have her and have the breasts. After, after she takes, I mean after she’s done, you know, 43 when my mom, her boyfriend came. 44 45 AJ: Mhm. 46 47 RS: She has a Philippine boyfriend. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 37 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Oh wow. 3 4 RS: It was, I wanna have it like that. 5 6 AJ: [Laughs]. 7 8 RS: I wanna have, I wanna be like her. 9 10 AJ: Sure. 11 12 RS: And she looks really happy. 13 14 AJ: Did you meet her? Did you have the chance to meet her? 15 16 RS: I don’t know. 17 18 AJ: Just saw her. 19 20 RS: I just saw her, but every time we go to that salon she’s there, and I look at her. It’s like she’s my 21 idol. 22 23 AJ: Right. 24 25 RS: I wanna be like this lady. She’s really, really feminine. And the way she takes care of herself, and 26 the way she takes care of people, you know. She’s like my role model at that time. 27 28 AJ: Wow. 29 30 RS: She inspires me. Oh when I grew up, when I am 17 after, you know, when I be at college, I want 31 to start the hormones. 32 33 AJ: Wow. Did you, so what is the first transgender person you met here in the United States then? 34 35 RS: The first transgender I think it, we were at the mall. I was at Target… 36 37 AJ: Mhm. 38 39 RS: … you know, and I knew she was a transgender. I can sense. 40 41 AJ: You can tell. 42 43 RS: Yes, I can tell. And she just goes into the makeup section, and she says, she asks me, “Where’s 44 the, do you know like, where, about lipsticks,” something like that. 45 46 AJ: Right. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 38 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota RS: And then I talked to her. And I saw, and I look at her. She’s 1 really confidant. 2 3 AJ: Mhm. 4 5 RS: She’s African American. 6 7 AJ: Oh really? 8 9 RS: Yeah, but she’s really beautiful, you know, she has really curvy body… 10 11 AJ: Yeah. 12 13 RS: … and big ass. 14 15 AJ: Oh my goodness. 16 17 RS: She’s so sexy, you know. And she was talking to me, you know, I was like, oh, okay. 18 19 AJ: What’s her name? Do you know? 20 21 RS: No, I didn’t. We were just talking about makeup. 22 23 AJ: Just talking about makeup. 24 25 RS: Yeah, she was just really friendly to me like, “Hi, how are you doing? Do you know where the 26 section on the map where lipstick?” 27 28 AJ: Mhm. 29 30 RS: “Oh, I think it’s in the next isle.” You know I talked to her and then after. 31 32 AJ: Mhm. 33 34 RS: We were talking already. I said, “Oh, you have really sexy body.” 35 36 AJ: Oh, wow. 37 38 RS: She said, “Actually I’m feeling fat because of winter.” 39 40 AJ: Oh, okay. 41 42 RS: “I get more comfortable eating inside the house.” And that’s how the conversation started. 43 44 AJ: Right. 45 46 RS: Then after I went to the, uh, Minnesota Transgender Coalition Support Group. That’s where I 47 made Rox, Sakura, Shimmer, and other. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 39 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Uhuh. 3 4 RS: That’s the time I get involved here. 5 6 AJ: Shimmer. S.H.I.M.M.E.R.? 7 8 RS: Yeah, yeah, Shimmer. 9 10 AJ: Rox. R.O.X. [Laughs]. 11 12 RS: Yeah. Rox and Sakura. S.A.K.U.R.A. 13 14 AJ: Yeah, yeah. 15 16 RS: They’re really, uhm, they’re really friendly. 17 18 AJ: Mhm. 19 20 RS: You know, they told to me, “Oh, you’re new here,” you know, uhm, like we went to the Laverne 21 Cox… 22 23 AJ: Yeah? 24 25 RS: Yeah. They invited me, I mean, they told me about it. So it’s good to get involved. 26 27 AJ: Yeah. Do you think you will ever volunteer or work with any transgender organizations to make 28 life better for trans people? 29 30 RS: Yeah, I would love to. I really, I would love to get involved with that. 31 32 AJ: Uhuh. Have you ever done it before? 33 34 RS: No, I haven’t. 35 36 AJ: In the Philippines, in Thailand? 37 38 RS: I haven’t done that in the Philippines or Thailand because it’s more different there. It’s more 39 strong here. 40 41 AJ: Mhm. 42 43 RS: You know, you’re more politically, uhm... 44 45 AJ: Engaged. 46 47 RS: … engaged here. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 40 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Yeah. 3 4 RS: You know, because you have your laws here. You’re very lucky. American people are really 5 lucky, you’re really lucky here actually when it comes to that. You’re very fortunate that, you 6 know, you live in a, you live in this country. 7 8 AJ: Well, a lot of people think we don’t have enough rights in this country. 9 10 RS: Yeah, but… 11 12 AJ: And they’re fighting for more rights. 13 14 RS: Yeah. But actually you have the right, you have, you have it here, you know, you just have to 15 fight more. You know, but I really wanted to participate to that. 16 17 AJ: Mhm. Yeah, well there’s lots of opportunities. Uhm, so in, in the Philippines, it’s kind of like, 18 based on what you’re telling me like people don’t see different between gay or transgender or 19 lesbian. Are there lesbians? 20 21 RS: Yeah, actually they call us all gay. 22 23 AJ: Right, everybody is gay. 24 25 RS: Everybody is gay. But here it’s different. 26 27 AJ: Even the women are gay. 28 29 RS: Yeah, even though she’s, she’s a lesbian you’ll always hear gay. We transgender is still gay. 30 31 AJ: Still gay. 32 33 RS: And when we have the pageant, they call it Mrs. Gay. 34 35 AJ: Oh really? 36 37 RS: Pageant for transgender is gay. 38 39 AJ: Is gay. [Laughs]. 40 41 RS: But in Thailand it’s different. 42 43 AJ: Right. 44 45 RS: Miss Stephanie, Miss, uhm, Miss Universe, Miss Super Universe, Miss Beautiful Trans. That’s 46 how it is there. But in the Philippines all gay. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 41 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Oh wow. [Laughs]. 2 3 RS: And the pronouns, it’s like, it’s not that important compared to here. It really matters here. Like 4 the she, when you call a transgender she, like in the Philippines, you’re still a he. They call you 5 mister. 6 7 AJ: Mm. 8 9 RS: It’s really sad sometimes. It hurts, you know. 10 11 AJ: Yeah. Uhm, I remember talking to Jena again, and she would tell me that, you know, they would 12 have, uhm, in her city, in her town, they would have all these pageants for transgender people 13 all the time, and they would sometimes even be on television. 14 15 RS: Yes. 16 17 AJ: Is it like that in your community? 18 19 RS: Yes. Same. 20 21 AJ: Okay. 22 23 RS: But, what you call it, is there Miss Gay, you know, it’s not good. 24 25 AJ: Cause you’re not gay. 26 27 RS: We’re not gay, you know, we’re transgender. We’re woman, you know? 28 29 AJ: Uhuh. 30 31 RS: It’s really, they have to be more open I hope. 32 33 AJ: Mhm. 34 35 RS: You know. 36 37 AJ: Do you think that, uhm, there’s more, so some people, some transgender people feel like I’m 38 not gay, I’m not lesbian. I’m transgender. So they don’t feel like they need to work with the 39 transgender, I mean, with the gay communities or lesbian communities or bisexual 40 communities. 41 42 RS: Mhm. 43 44 AJ: What do you think about that? Do you think it’s more power to all be together or if everybody 45 just goes their separate ways? 46 47 RS: I think… Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 42 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Cause the issues are different for transgender. 3 4 RS: Issues, yeah, are very different for trans and gay people as well, yeah. But I think it’s better 5 because we work as one? 6 7 AJ: Mhm. 8 9 RS: You know? But if you’re a transgender you would really feel in others labeled as all as one… 10 11 AJ: Mhm. 12 13 RS: … but gay people have their own issues. The transgender have their own issues. The lesbians 14 they have their own issues. But for me we have to be united because we are fighting for the 15 same, you know, for equality, for acceptance… 16 17 AJ: Mhm. 18 19 RS: … you know. For me it’s better that we unite all as one. 20 21 AJ: Mhm. 22 23 RS: And help each other, you know, whatever gender he, she prefers. 24 25 AJ: Right. Are there many, in the Philippines where you grew up, were there many women who 26 become men? 27 28 RS: Oh yes. There are women who become men, but not that much compared to the men who 29 become female. 30 31 AJ: Mhm. 32 33 RS: Yeah, it’s a lot in here, I think, I’ve seen like, they transition here more like the, from female to 34 male. 35 36 AJ: Uhuh. 37 38 RS: And they really look like a male. 39 40 AJ: I know. 41 42 RS: My god. 43 44 AJ: Yes. 45 46 RS: I was like that was so quick for them. After like a year, they fully transition. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 43 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota AJ: Right. The 1 hair, the muscles… 2 3 RS: Like with us like trans it takes some time. I mean it’s like 4 years, 5 years… 4 5 AJ: Yeah. 6 7 RS: … for me to feel like really confidant. 8 9 AJ: Uhuh. 10 11 RS: Cause I’m really feminine now. It’s really weird sometimes. 12 13 AJ: Wow. 14 15 RS: You know, there’s a lot… 16 17 AJ: Did you do electrolysis? Did you have… 18 19 RS: I, yeah, I had, I had laser but, uh, with the hormones I have no more hair. It’s like my hair doesn’t 20 grow anymore. 21 22 AJ: Yeah. Right. 23 24 RS: You know, the Adam’s apple, you know, and your body becomes, your skin becomes more soft. 25 No muscles at all, you know. 26 27 AJ: Sure. 28 29 RS: I like that. 30 31 AJ: Yeah. 32 33 RS: That really helps a lot. 34 35 AJ: Hm. So what do you think the agenda should be for the transgender community here and then 36 around the world internationally? 37 38 RS: For me, my agenda is that just respect, just the respect for us. I mean like, yeah, some people 39 see us as different. Some people think that we’re weird. You know, it’s like, but for me it’s like 40 just respect each other and respect one another. 41 42 AJ: Sure. 43 44 RS: And whatever we believe, I mean, this is who we are, you know, and respecting who you are as 45 well. 46 47 AJ: Mhm. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 44 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 RS: You know, that’s really my agenda is like we have our own rights as well, you know. We’re still 3 human, you know, we have the same, we have, we get angry, we get angry as well, you love, we 4 love as well. 5 6 AJ: Mhm. 7 8 RS: So just respecting us as we respect you. 9 10 AJ: Yeah. 11 12 RS: You know. 13 14 AJ: Where do you think the transgender community will be maybe in 50 years from now? Do you 15 think we will have that respect or do you think… 16 17 RS: I think so too. 18 19 AJ: Or do you think there will still be, eh. 20 21 RS: There will always be some people who are conservative. People who are homophobic or really 22 find us strange or weird when we change, that we transition. 23 24 AJ: Mhm. 25 26 RS: You know, the others will think it’s a sickness, you know, that, but for me as long as we fight for 27 what we believe for, you know, and we, uh, what you call it, we will not stop. We will become 28 more stronger. 29 30 AJ: Mhm. 31 32 RS: We will have the resistance. 33 34 AJ: Resistance. 35 36 RS: The resistance. 37 38 AJ: Yes. 39 40 RS: You know, it will change everything. 41 42 AJ: Uhuh. 43 44 RS: You know, actually, it’s more changing compared, it’s more accepting compared before. 45 46 AJ: Yeah, it is. It’s better. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 45 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota RS: It’s getting better, you know, so it’s like at least, we’re, uhm, I can see that in 1 50 years from now, 2 we’ll be moving more forward. 3 4 AJ: Mhm. 5 6 RS: You know. 7 8 AJ: Wow. 9 10 RS: More open. 11 12 AJ: More open. 13 14 RS: I hope. I’m really hoping for that. And I want to fight for that. 15 16 AJ: Yes. Yes. We need everybody. 17 18 RS: We need everybody. That’s why, whether you’re gay, lesbian, cisgender, right? We all fight the 19 same. 20 21 AJ: Mhm. 22 23 RS: So we have to join. 24 25 AJ: So what do you think about concept, Ashlee, the idea of what some people call passable 26 privilege? I’m mean, you’re very strikingly beautiful woman. 27 28 RS: Mhm. 29 30 AJ: Uhm, when you walk down the street here in the United States, most people they just think 31 you’re a beautiful woman. They don’t think you’re transgender. 32 33 RS: Yeah. 34 35 AJ: And, and some people, some transgender people feel like that’s a privilege. Like Janet Mock. 36 She’s very beautiful. Uh, Jena Rosetto. She’s very beautiful. Laverne Cox. 37 38 RS: Laverne Cox. 39 40 AJ: She’s very, very beautiful. 41 42 RS: Yeah. 43 44 AJ: Uhm, and, you know, some women aren’t, some transgender women are not that lucky, right? 45 Like… 46 47 RS: Mhm. Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 46 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: They sometimes look like they’re still a guy, and… 3 4 RS: Yeah. 5 6 AJ: And everybody can tell that they’re transgender. How do you feel about that? Do you think it’s a 7 real thing or is it…? 8 9 RS: It’s really a big, it’s, I’m very privileged, you know, we have like, I’m passable. They call it 10 passable here? 11 12 AJ: Mhm. Yeah, yeah. 13 14 RS: You know, it’s like, they won’t’ even know. Like when I was riding a taxi, an uber, “Oh, Happy 15 Mother’s Day.” I was like, “Okay.” 16 17 AJ: Right. [Laughs]. 18 19 RS: Or, “Do you have kids?” That’s his first question. I was like, I’m privileged when it comes to that. 20 21 AJ: Sure. 22 23 RS: I feel really bad and sad for other transgender people like they want to dress, wear sexy, I mean, 24 like something, we all have, like we want to date. We wanna wear skirts or enjoy the summer. 25 26 AJ: Right. 27 28 RS: Or enjoy the sun, have the sun on our skin. And others get bullied or, you know, they get 29 discriminated against. I feel sad about that. 30 31 AJ: Mhm. 32 33 RS: You know, it’s like for me and other people, when I see people who is different or, you know, 34 when he dress different for me it’s like it doesn’t matter. That’s what he wants to be. That’s how 35 he defines himself. 36 37 AJ: Sure. 38 39 RS: You know. So I feel sad when, when I hear stories like when they share stories like they’ve been 40 bullied or they’re being laughed a lot outside, you know. 41 42 AJ: Mhm. 43 44 RS: I feel really sad about it. It’s like, if only I could… What can I do to comfort you? 45 46 AJ: [Laughs]. Right. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 47 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota RS: Cause, you know, I’ve been in that situation as well, and it feels really terrible. 1 You feel down. 2 3 AJ: Right. 4 5 RS: You know, you get, you get scared about it so it’s like… with me I feel privileged, but I feel sad 6 for some. 7 8 AJ: Mhm. Mhm. 9 10 RS: You know? But I think more hormones, the more you take hormones and when you take your 11 surgeries and stuff like that it really changes. 12 13 AJ: Some people more hormones is not gonna change very much, but… 14 15 RS: Yes, some, some. 16 17 AJ: Yeah. 18 19 RS: Some really don’t, they’re still like man. 20 21 AJ: You, you transitioned when you were 17, which is different from someone who waits until 22 maybe they’re 50. 23 24 RS: Yeah. 25 26 AJ: You know? Before, I mean, they wait, they’re afraid. They don’t want to be harassed, you know? 27 There’s reasons why people wait. But so let me just ask you this last question, Ashlee. Is there 28 anything that you feel compelled to say that I did not ask you? I want to give you that 29 opportunity. About your life. About the transgender community. About whatever it is that you 30 wanna say. 31 32 RS: I just wanna, I’m just really privileged, you know, that I have this interview with you. I get to 33 share. 34 35 AJ: Yeah, thank you. 36 37 RS: You know, and, uhm, I just want to share that, like I feel really blessed to be in the United States. 38 39 AJ: Mhm. 40 41 RS: You know, other, some trans people, I mean, some American transgender, they would think 42 that, you know, that, they feel like they have to, it’s like the government is trying to, to stop 43 them. You know, it’s like, but for me it’s like, you’re still lucky to be here. 44 45 AJ: Yeah. 46 47 RS: That’s one thing I would truly want to say. You know like… Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 48 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Cause they don’t know about the other. 3 4 RS: They don’t know what’s happening outside of United States. 5 6 AJ: Right. 7 8 RS: And for me it’s like being here to have, to be married. My marriage will be legally accepted. I can 9 change my gender marker. I have my name change. I can work here. Like my hair is long. I can 10 dress however I want. It’s such a privilege for me. 11 12 AJ: Yeah. 13 14 RS: And I’m really, really thankful for that. 15 16 AJ: Wow. 17 18 RS: Whatever they fight for here in America, you know, is like, especially with the gender issue, I’m 19 really, I’m really into it. For me it’s like this one thing that I want, I’m concerned, it’s just a 20 bathroom. 21 22 AJ: Mhm. 23 24 RS: It’s just a bathroom, you know? Like, it’s not a big deal actually. 25 26 AJ: Uhuh. 27 28 RS: You know, it’s like you can go wherever you want. 29 30 AJ: Right. 31 32 RS: That’s really one thing that I hope the government can, will not move backwards, you know, and 33 want to help the transgender community about that. 34 35 AJ: Mhm. 36 37 RS: It’s just a bathroom. 38 39 AJ: That’s it. And every human being has to go. 40 41 RS: Every human being has to go. 42 43 AJ: [Laughs]. 44 45 RS: I’m really, uhm, what you call it, being a transgender is like you get more confidant when you 46 are yourself. 47 Renan (Ashlee) Sapalaran Interview 49 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 AJ: Mhm. 2 3 RS: You know? So it’s like you can go whatever bathroom you want. 4 5 AJ: Right. [Laughs]. 6 7 RS: Why do you make it a big issue? 8 9 AJ: Why make it a big deal, right? Well, listen, I really appreciate this opportunity to, to learn more 10 about you, and thank you so much for sharing your, your story, and, uhm, and your life. And, 11 you’re right, we are blessed, uhm, in this community. We still have a lot more to do. 12 13 RS: Yeah. 14 15 AJ: Uhm, it’s much better. 16 17 RS: it’s much better here than Uganda or Brazil, you know, some transgender get… 18 19 AJ: Murdered. 20 21 RS: … get murdered. 22 23 AJ: Yeah. 24 25 RS: You know? That’s really sad, and, uh, what do you call this, uhm, you still feel, you have the 26 power here. The voice out. 27 28 AJ: Yeah. 29 30 RS: You know? 31 32 AJ: To speak out. 33 34 RS: To speak out and fight for resistance. 35 36 AJ: Yes. Alright, well thank you, Ashlee. 37 38 RS: Thank you so much as well, Andrea. 39 40 AJ: Alright, bye bye. 41 42 RS: Bye bye.
