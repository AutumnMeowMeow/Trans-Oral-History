The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota Nichole Moravec Narrator Andrea Jenkins Interviewer The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota March 30, 2017 Nichole Moravec 2 The Transgender Oral History Project of the Upper Midwest will empower individuals to tell their story, while providing students, historians, and the public with a more rich foundation of primary source material about the transgender community. The project is part of the Tretter Collection at the University of Minnesota. The archive provides a record of GLBT thought, knowledge and culture for current and future generations and is available to students, researchers and members of the public. The Transgender Oral History Project will collect up to 400 hours of oral histories involving 200 to 300 individuals over the next three years. Major efforts will be the recruitment of individuals of all ages and experiences, and documenting the work of The Program in Human Sexuality. This project will be led by Andrea Jenkins, poet, writer, and trans-activist. Andrea brings years of experience working in government, non-profits and LGBT organizations.

Andrea Jenkins jenki120@umn.edu (612) 625-4379 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 Andrea Jenkins -AJ 2 Nichole Moravec -NM 3 4 AJ: So, hello. My name is Andrea Jenkins, and I am the oral historian - historian for the Tretter 5 Collection Transgender Oral History Project at the University of Minnesota. Today is March 30th, 6 2017. I am in the lovely, bucolic town of Winona, Minnesota, on the campus of Winona State 7 University, on the banks of the Mississippi River. 8 NM: Yup. 9 AJ: And I’m here today with Nichole Moravec. 10 NM: Yup. 11 AJ: Did I say that right? 12 NM: Yup! 13 AJ: How you doing today, Nichole? 14 NM: I’m doing well! I’m really excited to be here. 15 AJ: Yeah? 16 NM: Yeah. 17 AJ: Oh, wow, that’s awesome. I’m excited to be here, too. It’s always great to just hear the - the 18 different experiences of trans and gender nonconforming people. 19 NM: Mmhmm. 20 AJ: So, Nichole, if you can state your name, and - your full name, how you spell it. So we make sure 21 we have all that correct. Please tell me your gender identity as you define it today, and your 22 gender assigned at birth, and what pronouns, if any, do you use? 23 NM: Okay. So my full name is Nichole Moravec, N-I-C-H-O-L-E M-O-R-A-V-E-C. I was assigned female 24 at birth, but I myself identify as nonbinary, and I use they/them/theirs pronouns. 25 AJ: Hmm. They/them/their. So when you say nonbinary, what does that mean for you? 26 NM: For me, it’s somewhere in the middle of the gender binary. 27 AJ: Mmhmm. 28 NM: I know for a fact that I don’t really identify with female, and I wouldn’t want to fully transition 29 into male. 30 AJ: Sure. 31 NM: And that took me a long time to figure out. 32 AJ: Yeah? Nichole Moravec 2 1 NM: So. 2 AJ: ‘Cause the world tries to push people into some box. 3 NM: Right. Yup. 4 AJ: Like, they get confused when you say “My pronoun is they and them.” 5 NM: Mmhmm. Yeah. 6 AJ: Yeah? 7 NM: Yeah! “I don’t know how to say that for one person.” You just say it! 8 AJ: Well, it’s interesting, I think Webster dictionary, Merriam-Webster dictionary, just included it as 9 a singular pronoun. 10 NM: Mmhmm. Yup. 11 AJ: In the dictionary. 12 NM: Mmhmm. 13 AJ: Which is kind of interesting. 14 NM: Yeah. 15 AJ: And kind of profound, actually. 16 NM: Right. 17 AJ: It’s like, the nonbinary gender code is sort of catching steam. 18 NM: Mmhmm. 19 AJ: So - I mean, that means you’re, like - like, on the cutting edge. 20 NM: Yeah. 21 AJ: Of - of human societal transformation. 22 NM: Yeah. 23 AJ: Like, that’s a big deal. 24 NM: Yeah. It’s definitely come a long way since I came out two years ago, gender-wise. 25 AJ: Okay. 26 NM: I really only knew of one other binary - or, nonbinary person that I had, like, met - 27 AJ: Mmhmm. Right. 28 NM: But other than that - 29 AJ: Who was that person? Do you remember? Nichole Moravec 3 NM: Their name was Alec. I met them my freshman 1 year of college. 2 AJ: Mmhmm. So here - a student here at Winona State? 3 NM: They did go here but then ended up transferring. 4 AJ: Okay. 5 NM: But - yeah. And then I met them, and they explained what their gender was, and their pronouns, 6 and everything, and I was like “Oh my god. I think that’s it.” 7 AJ: Wow. That’s - that’s me, huh? 8 NM: Yeah. 9 AJ: Wow. So let’s kind of start from the beginning, Nichole. Like, what - what’s your earliest memory 10 in life? And it doesn’t have to have anything to do with your gender identity, even though if it 11 does, that’s fine, ‘cause a lot of times, it is wrapped up around our gender identity. 12 NM: Mmhmm. Right. 13 AJ: Yeah, what’s the first thing you remember in life? 14 NM: Oof. I don’t know. That’s a hard question. I think when I think back about my childhood, I just 15 remember running around outside. 16 AJ: Yeah? 17 NM: All the time. 18 AJ: Uh huh. 19 NM: Never really wanted to be in the house, I just wanted to be outside playing. 20 AJ: Oh. 21 NM: Whatever. Riding - 22 AJ: Where did you grow up? 23 NM: Faribault, Minnesota. 24 AJ: Is that right? 25 NM: Yup. 26 AJ: How far is that from here? 27 NM: It’s about two hours. 28 AJ: Okay. 29 NM: Two hour drive. So in between here and the cities. 30 AJ: Here and the Twin Cities. Nichole Moravec 4 1 NM: Yup. 2 AJ: Yeah. What was life like in Faribault? Was it a town that you could just run around outside and 3 be free? Was it that kind of environment? 4 NM: No, not really. Faribault kind of has a lot of drug problems. 5 AJ: Oh, wow. 6 NM: So that was always a thing. Usually - 7 AJ: Even when you were a kid? 8 NM: Yup. 9 AJ: Wow. 10 NM: Yup. It’s gotten a lot worse, too. 11 AJ: Like, opiates and… 12 NM: Meth, a lot. 13 AJ: Pills, and meth? 14 NM: Yup. 15 AJ: Really. Wow. 16 NM: Yup. So...just kind of stayed around the neighborhood - 17 AJ: Mmhmm. 18 NM: Where parents could keep an eye on you. 19 AJ: Yeah. 20 NM: So. 21 AJ: So it’s kind of - I mean, it’s a built up town? I don’t think I’ve ever been to Faribault. 22 NM: Yeah. I would kind of compare it to Winona, actually. 23 AJ: Really? Okay. 24 NM: Yeah. It’s kind of got that history that everyone’s obsessed with. 25 AJ: Mmhmm. Right. 26 NM: All that. But - yeah. I was definitely glad to get out of there after I graduated high school. 27 AJ: So you came to another small town. 28 NM: Yeah. 29 AJ: What was - what was grade school like, and high school, and school life like? Nichole Moravec 5 NM: Well, I came - I came out, sexuality-wise, 1 in middle school. 2 AJ: Really? 3 NM: Yeah. I told - 4 AJ: As...what was your identity? 5 NM: Well, at first it was bisexual. 6 AJ: Really? 7 NM: Yup. 8 AJ: In middle school? 9 NM: Yup. Yeah. 10 AJ: How did your parents respond to that? Well - who did you come out to, I should say. 11 NM: Well, the first person I came out to was my brother Davin. And obviously he was supportive. 12 AJ: Uh huh. Yeah, yeah. 13 NM: And - 14 AJ: And when you say obviously, ‘cause people might not know, but Davin was a participant in this 15 project. And Davin - I don’t think we’re outing Daien - Davin identifies as a transmasculine 16 person. 17 NM: Yup. 18 AJ: Right? 19 NM: Yup. 20 AJ: Yeah. Okay. 21 NM: Yeah. So - 22 AJ: So Davin was supportive. You came out to - to Davin first. 23 NM: Yeah. And then came out to a couple of my close friends. For the most part, they were 24 supportive. And then I fully came out to everyone in eighth grade. 25 AJ: Wow. 26 NM: And then - still as bisexual. And then when I ident - when I still identified as a woman, I came out 27 as lesbian in ninth grade. 28 AJ: Mmhmm. Okay. Wow. 29 NM: Yeah. So kind of boom, boom, boom, boom. 30 AJ: Wow. You’re having this awareness of who Nichole is at a very young age. Nichole Moravec 6 NM: Yeah. Yeah. And I think I kind of owe a lot of that to Davin, ‘cause I don’t think 1 if I - if I wouldn’t 2 have grown up with a queer sibling, I wouldn’t have been exposed to that so young. 3 AJ: Mmhmm. Sure. Right, right. 4 NM: So I’m, like, really grateful that I did. 5 AJ: Mmhmm. 6 NM: So it was just kind of like, I had someone there who got it, full support, stood by me. 7 AJ: Mmhmm. 8 NM: So that was really great. 9 AJ: So you came out as bisexual in middle school. 10 NM: Mmhmm. 11 AJ: Lesbian in ninth grade. 12 NM: Yup. 13 AJ: Have you worn any other identities before gender nonconforming? 14 NM: Yup. I came out as nonbinary my junior year of college. 15 AJ: Wow. 16 NM: Yup. 17 AJ: So that’s when you met Alec. 18 NM: Well, I met Alec freshman year. 19 AJ: Mmhmm. 20 NM: But kind of went through a whole realm of self-shame for a couple years before I was ready to 21 actually - 22 AJ: Yeah. Accept yourself? 23 NM: Yup. A lot of internalized transphobia. And - 24 AJ: What does that mean? 25 NM: Well, to me, it was just...the thought of “I can’t be this way, I don’t want to be this way.” 26 AJ: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. 27 NM: And a lot of those thoughts, and just thinking that I wasn’t going to fit in anyway, I wasn’t going 28 to find a partner, things like that. 29 AJ: Sure. 30 NM: And then it just got to a point where I couldn’t keep it to myself anymore. Nichole Moravec 7 1 AJ: Mmhmm. 2 NM: And was just kind of - 3 AJ: Became overwhelming, so to speak? 4 NM: Yeah. I actually came out to a friend freshman year and I just said that I was trans, but I didn’t - 5 that was before I had met this other person, Alec. 6 AJ: Sure. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. 7 NM: And then I was like, I think I’m trans, but I don’t know. 8 AJ: Right. 9 NM: And then - I never really wanted to talk about it for a while. 10 AJ: Mmhmm. 11 NM: So I didn’t. And then kind of just started exploring stuff on the internet myself, and really looking 12 into what genderqueer was, and what nonbinary was. 13 AJ: Mmhmm. 14 NM: And realizing that that’s a valid gender identity. 15 AJ: Right. 16 NM: ‘Cause a lot of people aren’t educated on that. And I was one of those people, so once I kind of 17 found the answers, every year our gender and sexuality alliance, Full Spectrum - 18 AJ: Mmhmm. 19 NM: We go to a conference called Mumbletech. I don’t know if you’re familiar with it. 20 AJ: Mumble? 21 NM: Mumbletech. 22 AJ: M-U-23 NM: M-B-L-G-T-A-C-C. 24 AJ: Wow. 25 NM: Yeah, it’s a mouthful. 26 AJ: Where does that happen? 27 NM: Every year it’s different. This last year, it was in Chicago. 28 AJ: Mmhmm. 29 NM: And then next year it’s in Nebraska, I think. Yeah. So, my - 30 AJ: And what is it? Nichole Moravec 8 NM: It’s just a huge, like, queer college 1 conference. 2 AJ: Uh huh. 3 NM: So it’s - it’s the, like, Midwest one, but it’s the biggest one in the nation. 4 AJ: Mmhmm. 5 NM: So you go to workshop, keynotes, and then they have, like, night entertainment and stuff, so. 6 AJ: Mmhmm. But it’s mostly - genderqueer, or is it LGBT? 7 NM: It’s LGBT, yeah. Yup. 8 AJ: Okay. 9 NM: So my junior year, the last workshop I went to was called “Are You Trans?” And I was like, “This 10 is the workshop that I need to be at!” And the presenter was nonbinary. 11 AJ: Okay. 12 NM: And really kind of dived into what it is, what it means, and pronouns and stuff. 13 AJ: Mmhmm. 14 NM: And I was like, “Okay. I think I have my answer.” 15 AJ: Wow. 16 NM: So then I came out to my exec board of Full Spectrum. 17 AJ: Mmhmm. 18 NM: And then at our next meeting - ‘cause we always say our name and pronouns at the beginning of 19 each meeting. 20 AJ: Mmhmm. 21 NM: And then I kind of came out that next week to my peers at Full Spectrum. 22 AJ: So Full Spectrum is a student group? 23 NM: Yup. Yup. 24 AJ: On campus here at Winona? 25 NM: Mmhmm. I’m actually one of the co-presidents. 26 AJ: Is that right? 27 NM: Yeah. 28 AJ: That’s awesome. 29 NM: Yeah. Nichole Moravec 9 AJ: So - and you - there was a fuller name. 1 Full Spectrum… 2 NM: Winona State’s Gender and Sexuality Alliance. 3 AJ: Oh, okay. Wow. So this conference was really, like, a turning point for you. 4 NM: Mmhmm. 5 AJ: Though you had been on this, sort of, identity journey - 6 NM: Yup. 7 AJ: - for a while. 8 NM: Yeah. 9 AJ: And you identified as bisexual, lesbian… 10 NM: Mmhmm. 11 AJ: Eventually becoming - becoming to nonbinary as a - as a coat that really fit you well. 12 NM: Mmhmm. Yup. 13 AJ: What was home like? I know you talked a little bit about your sibling. Were there other siblings, 14 or just the two of you guys? 15 NM: Just Davin and I. And we have different dads. But my mom had custody. 16 AJ: Okay. Mmhmm. 17 NM: So we were together all the time. 18 AJ: Oh, really. 19 NM: Until he graduated. 20 AJ: Right. 21 NM: Or I - he was at his dad’s, like, every other weekend or something, so. 22 AJ: Yeah. 23 NM: We grew up in the same house. 24 AJ: Mmhmm. 25 NM: My dad and Davin did not get along. At all. 26 AJ: I heard about that. 27 NM: Yeah. My dad and I did not get along for a while as well, but not to the extent that it was with 28 Davin. 29 AJ: Do you think the experience with Davin - Davin’s sort of gender identity helped or hurt in your 30 situation? Nichole Moravec 10 NM: I think - hmm. That’s 1 tough. I think - 2 AJ: ‘Cause Davin’s a little older than you are, right? 3 NM: Yeah. He’s seven years older. 4 AJ: Yeah. 5 NM: Family-wise, it helps and doesn’t help. And this is why: it helps because he was kind of the one 6 to get everyone - 7 AJ: The pioneer? 8 NM: Yeah. But then it - it also becomes a thing of, “Well, is Nichole just doing this because Davin is.” 9 AJ: Because Davin is doing it, yeah. 10 NM: And I thought that might be the case myself for a while, too. 11 AJ: Mmhmm. 12 NM: But...I...no. 13 AJ: Yeah. 14 NM: Yeah. So, it’s kind of half and half. 15 AJ: Mmhmm. 16 NM: And then - 17 AJ: I mean, like you said - I mean, Davin created this knowledge base and this awareness of - 18 NM: Right. 19 AJ: But you - you were having these feelings. 20 NM: Mmhmm. 21 AJ: Right? 22 NM: Right. 23 AJ: I mean, there’s lots of families with gay siblings and the other siblings are not… 24 NM: Right. 25 AJ: Gay, right? 26 NM: Right. 27 AJ: Just because your sibling is gay doesn’t mean you’re going to be. 28 NM: Exactly. 29 AJ: Or just because your sibling is a brain surgeon doesn’t mean you’re - like, you know? Nichole Moravec 11 1 NM: Yeah. Right. 2 AJ: You know what I mean? So. 3 NM: Mmhmm. 4 AJ: So...well, clearly you guys have different dads, so - 5 NM: Mmhmm. 6 AJ: Your parents - I mean, there was a divorce somewhere along the way. 7 NM: Yup. 8 AJ: And...but you grew up in an intact fam - I mean, like, mom, dad, were both in the home? 9 NM: Yup. Until...I think they got a divorce when I was fifteen. 10 AJ: Oh, okay. 11 NM: So then I was mostly with my mom, and then with my dad every once in a while. Just because 12 my dad and I didn’t - did not get along at that point. 13 AJ: Sure. Yeah. 14 NM: So it kind of got to a point where my mom was like, you don’t have to be there if you don’t want 15 to. 16 AJ: Mmhmm. 17 NM: So I decided not to be. 18 AJ: How’s your relationship with your dad now? 19 NM: It’s great, actually. 20 AJ: Yeah? Wow! 21 NM: Yeah. 22 AJ: Wow. That’s awesome. 23 NM: Yeah. It’s awesome. 24 AJ: Ha, I’m so happy to hear that. 25 NM: Yeah. It’s surprising, too. I never really expected to have the relationship that I do with him now, 26 just because of how it was when I was growing up. 27 AJ: Mmhmm. 28 NM: But he’s apologized numerous times. 29 AJ: Wow. 30 NM: Realizes that he was kind of a shit father and acknowledges that and talks to me about it and I Nichole Moravec 12 just have a lot of respect for him for that. So it’s an easy - an easier way to 1 kind of move on from 2 that. 3 AJ: Yeah. 4 NM: Like, that’s - that, like, shitty stuff is always going to be there - 5 AJ: Mmhmm. 6 NM: But moving past it and kind of getting over that - 7 AJ: Right. 8 NM: I think is important, as I’m getting older. 9 AJ: No, absolutely. So when did you first realize that something about your gender wasn’t the way 10 the rest of the world kind of thought about how a little girl should be? 11 NM: Well, I like to think that my story is different than a lot of people. 12 AJ: Okay. 13 NM: ‘Cause - 14 AJ: That’s good. We all have different stories. 15 NM: The popular belief is, “Oh, I knew ever since I was two years old.” 16 AJ: Right. Yes. 17 NM: But I honestly had no idea until I came to college. 18 AJ: Uh huh. 19 NM: And got, like, immersed into the community and started educating myself more. 20 AJ: Sure. 21 NM: But - yeah, I guess it was - I always felt like there was something missing with my sexuality. 22 AJ: Mmhmm. 23 NM: Like, went from bisexual to lesbian, and I thought that was it. Then after that it was still like 24 something was missing. And then that’s when I really started to explore my gender, so…yeah. 25 Didn’t start until college. 26 AJ: College, wow. 27 NM: Mmhmm. 28 AJ: And now you are in your last semester as - I think you said a five-year senior? 29 NM: Yup. 30 AJ: What are you studying? Nichole Moravec 13 NM: I’m studying Business Administration, and then I have a Women’s 1 Studies minor. 2 AJ: So are you going to be a capitalist or are you going to burn down the system? Like...women’s 3 studies and - and - and - 4 NM: I know. Yeah. 5 AJ: - business administration! Like... 6 NM: I know, it’s kind of polar opposites. But for now, just so I can kind of get on my feet financially, 7 and I hate this, but I’m going with the company that I work for right now, which is Fastenal. 8 AJ: Okay. 9 NM: I have a position waiting for me up in the cities. 10 AJ: What do they do at Fastenal? What is that place? 11 NM: Well, right now I work in the factory, and Fastenal’s like, big for their fasteners, so like, nuts and 12 bolts. 13 AJ: Oh, okay. 14 NM: So stuff like that. They produce that. 15 AJ: So it’s a manufacturing company. 16 NM: Yup. And in the cities, I’ll be starting in sales this summer, so kind of making the transition from 17 factory to sales. 18 AJ: Wow. 19 NM: And then in the fall he pretty much told me I could go wherever I wanted in the Twin Cities. 20 AJ: Yes. 21 NM: So I’m really hoping to get in somewhere in, like, Minneapolis or St. Paul. 22 AJ: Sure. 23 NM: Yeah. 24 AJ: That’s awesome. 25 NM: And then once I get my loans paid off, then I think I’ll look for work elsewhere. 26 AJ: Mmhmm. I was only - I was literally totally teasing you. Like, you - 27 NM: No! No, I know! 28 AJ: You can go work for - 29 NM: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 30 AJ: - on Wall Street at, you know - Nichole Moravec 14 1 NM: Yeah. Right. 2 AJ: Burns, Bear Stearns, or wherever you want to go. 3 NM: No, it’s just like - 4 AJ: I’m - don’t let me - 5 NM: Right. Right - no. And - that’s something I’ve definitely been struggling with a lot lately, ‘cause I 6 really don’t want to be at Fastenal for the rest of my life. 7 AJ: Mmhmm. 8 NM: But it’s just kind of something I have to do for now. 9 AJ: Yeah. 10 NM: And then I can really use my activism and my Women’s Studies minor once I kind of establish 11 myself more, I think. 12 AJ: Well, it’s honest work, and, you know, one of the challenges for a lot of trans-identified people 13 is employment. Like - 14 NM: Right. 15 AJ: You know. So...you have a - a job waiting for you when you graduate from college, and - 16 NM: Right. Mmhmm. 17 AJ: I mean, I think you should consider that a - a blessing. 18 NM: Yeah. Definitely. 19 AJ: Yeah. ‘Cause a lot of college students graduating and they’re looking six, ten months for a job 20 before they - 21 NM: Right. Yeah. 22 AJ: - land on something. So. 23 NM: Yup. 24 AJ: That’s pretty awesome. 25 NM: Mmhmm. 26 AJ: What challenges have you faced navigating the world as a nonbinary person? 27 NM: I could talk for hours about that. I think the biggest one is just people not being educated on 28 what nonbinary is. 29 AJ: Mmhmm. 30 NM: ‘Cause the world pretty much revolves around the gender binary. Nichole Moravec 15 1 AJ: Yup. 2 NM: So I’ve really had to kind of take it upon myself to educate people on what nonbinary is and 3 using they/them pronouns and...I think the pronouns is probably the hardest part for people to 4 grasp. 5 AJ: Mmhmm. 6 NM: Using they/them in a singular way. But - and it’s also figuring out when it’s safe to come out and 7 when it’s safer to not. 8 AJ: Mmhmm. 9 NM: So, like, if someone calls me ma’am at Wal-Mart, I’m not going to sit there and be like “Well, you 10 know actually!” 11 AJ: Right. Yeah. 12 NM: So - but - 13 AJ: “The gender binary is a social construct that is…” 14 NM: Right! But on campus I have conversations about it every day. 15 AJ: Mmhmm. 16 NM: Because it’s kind of my safe place to do that, I guess, so… 17 AJ: Do you get called ma’am at Wal-Mart? 18 NM: Oh, yeah. 19 AJ: That happens? 20 NM: And it’s like, “Um...I wear this chest binder, what tells you anything?” 21 AJ: Yeah. Right. Yeah, like, where are you getting these signals from, right? 22 NM: Exactly. I’m - I don’t really think I look like a typical woman, so, I don’t… 23 AJ: Yeah. No. Yeah. I don’t know. People would make assumptions and... 24 NM: Yup. 25 AJ: And once they - once they identify you as one or the other, then they’re kind of stuck on that, 26 you know? 27 NM: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yup. And I think a lot of the time when I’m meeting someone new, my 28 name is a feminine name, so, like, right away, they’re like “Oh, female.” 29 AJ: Mmhmm. Mmm. 30 NM: And I’m like “Uhh, actually…not.” 31 AJ: Yeah. Yeah. Do you have any thoughts or ideas around changing your name, or are you going to Nichole Moravec 16 1 leave it? I mean - 2 NM: It’s something - 3 AJ: I think it works, it’s a beautiful name. 4 NM: Yeah. 5 AJ: I mean, it’s a fine name, but... 6 NM: Right. I don’t know. I’m kind of half and half with that. Like, I really like my name. 7 AJ: Mmhmm. 8 NM: I don’t have a problem with it. But the only thing is is that in, like, society’s eyes, that’s a more 9 feminine name. So I automatically get that female label from most people. So I don’t think I 10 should have to change my name just because of other people, you know? 11 AJ: Right. 12 NM: And that’s why I’m ultimately decided to keep my birth name. 13 AJ: Mmhmm. 14 NM: Just kind of reclaiming that. 15 AJ: Yeah. 16 NM: Mmhmm. 17 AJ: Any problems with, like, institutions, the school? Like, how does Winona State respond to 18 gender nonbinary people? 19 NM: Well...I’m a business major. 20 AJ: Mmhmm. 21 NM: So when I send out those emails before the semester starts being like, “Hey, this is something 22 that you need to know about me…” 23 AJ: Mmhmm. 24 NM: A lot of business professors have never heard of that before. 25 AJ: Okay. 26 NM: So I get a lot of responses like “Oh, thanks for letting me know. I’ll try.” 27 AJ: Mmm. 28 NM: “But I can’t make any promises that I won’t mess up.” 29 AJ: Wow. 30 NM: Yeah. Nichole Moravec 17 AJ: What about to your gender, women’s 1 studies classes? 2 NM: Oh, they’re - it’s awesome. 3 AJ: Yeah? 4 NM: Yeah. Like, boom, first day we pretty much everyone says their pronouns, so. 5 AJ: Mmhmm. 6 NM: Yeah. 7 AJ: Yeah. How are the kids in the business classes? 8 NM: Ugh. I’m mostly just out to my professors. 9 AJ: Yeah. 10 NM: I’m not really - 11 AJ: ‘Cause the - 12 NM: - friends with a lot of business majors. 13 AJ: - students don’t really need to know, right? 14 NM: Right. It - it’ll just go over their head anyways, so… 15 AJ: Mmhmm. 16 NM: Why would I waste the energy when I really don’t care? 17 AJ: Yeah. Well, what do - what do you think about this idea that we do need to push gender 18 awareness into the faces of the, quote, non-initiated, like...like, everybody has a gender. 19 NM: Right. 20 AJ: It’s just, some people have the privilege of not thinking - of not having to think about it. 21 NM: Right. 22 AJ: Like, what’s your thoughts around that? I mean, I know you said it - sometimes it’s not worth 23 the time to really... 24 NM: Mmhmm. 25 AJ: And I agree. Yeah - if you’re in the middle of a statistics test, like, that’s not the time to really - 26 NM: Right. 27 AJ: - do gender 101. Like... 28 NM: Yeah. 29 AJ: But...are there moments when you think “I need to broaden the awareness of some non-like-30 minded people”? Nichole Moravec 18 NM: Yeah. I think a lot of the times when I have to do, like, group projects 1 or group papers. 2 AJ: Okay. 3 NM: Then I kind of have to assess the people in my group, and if it’s safe to - 4 AJ: Mmhmm. Sure. 5 NM: - tell them my identity. But on my laptop - everyone gets a laptop at Winona State. 6 AJ: Oh, really? Okay. 7 NM: Yup. 8 AJ: Mmhmm. 9 NM: On my laptop, I have this big sticker at the top that’s the trans flag, and then it has “they/them.” 10 So it’s like, I just kind of flip open my laptop and I’m like, “Hello!” 11 AJ: Bingo! 12 NM: So, yeah. 13 AJ: You also rock a Fuck Trump button. 14 NM: Yes I do! 15 AJ: I would have to imagine there’s a few - a couple - one or two Trump voters on this campus. 16 NM: Oh, yeah. Yeah. 17 AJ: And that’s probably putting it mildly. 18 NM: Yeah. Yeah. Yup. 19 AJ: Have you had any interactions or altercations around that at all? 20 NM: I surprisingly haven’t. I mean, I’m aware that it might happen when I wear the button, but I 21 don’t really care. 22 AJ: Yeah. 23 NM: But - yeah. The only comments I’ve gotten from it were positive, so. 24 AJ: Okay. 25 NM: LIke, “Oh my god, I love your button.” Like, thanks. 26 AJ: Yeah. Have there been, like, protests, either for or against the new administration here? 27 NM: Yes, there have been. We had a protest against the muslim ban. 28 AJ: Good. 29 NM: And - Nichole Moravec 19 AJ: 1 Were you involved? 2 NM: Yup. I’m actually one of the members of our Keep Council, which is more or less the - 3 AJ: K-E-E-P? 4 NM: K-E-A-P. 5 AJ: K-E-A-P. 6 NM: It stands for Acknowledgment, Empowerment, Advocacy, and Pluralism. 7 AJ: Oh, wow. Okay. 8 NM: So, that’s kind of like, the more or less diversity, like, council. 9 AJ: Mmhmm. Sure. 10 NM: So, we put those demonstrations together. 11 AJ: Mmhmm. 12 NM: And also - few weeks back, we did a No DaPL demonstration as well. 13 AJ: Really? 14 NM: Yup. 15 AJ: Wow. 16 NM: And we marched down to the Wells Fargo in town. 17 AJ: Nice! 18 NM: Yeah. It was awesome. And it was pouring that day. 19 AJ: Right? 20 NM: And that - I think that was just awesome. 21 AJ: Yeah. The water was crying out to you guys. 22 NM: Right. Yeah. 23 AJ: Yeah. Oh, that’s beautiful. 24 NM: Mmhmm. 25 AJ: So, to me, that says you have some ideas or some thoughts around intersections and 26 intersectionality. 27 NM: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. 28 AJ: Would you like to share some of your thoughts around that? 29 NM: Yeah. I mean - well, being president of Full Spectrum, always trying to reach everyone, make Nichole Moravec 20 sure that the space is inclusive, 1 obviously. 2 AJ: Sure. Mmhmm. 3 NM: In the past, our club has been a lot of white queer kids. 4 AJ: Yeah? 5 NM: And this is actually my second year of being co-president. 6 AJ: Mmhmm. 7 NM: So last year, it was kind of, like, setting all that up, trying to make those connections again with 8 the other clubs. 9 AJ: Student groups? 10 NM: Yup. 11 AJ: Mmhmm. 12 NM: And then this year was really, like, making those relationships, so. Hanging out in the KEAP 13 center when I have free time, having conversations with people, asking people what they want 14 and need, if they were to come to Full Spectrum, and this is the best attendance we’ve had in 15 years. 16 AJ: Really? 17 NM: Yeah. 18 AJ: So your work is paying off. 19 NM: Yeah. 20 AJ: Yeah, no, that’s great. What have been some of the joys since you’ve come out and began to 21 express your nonbinary gender identity? 22 NM: Well, it’s definitely that weight lifted off, like, wow, I finally figured it out. I can finally be who I 23 am and I finally know who I am. And...just really finding my group of friends who are there for 24 me unconditionally. 25 AJ: Yeah. 26 NM: And I think...probably one of the most, like, satisfying things is that there are a lot of freshmen 27 this year in the club, and at least five of them have come out as genderqueer, nonbinary, 28 genderfluid. 29 AJ: Is that right? 30 NM: Yeah. Like, since coming here and, like, meeting me, and stuff. 31 AJ: Uh huh. 32 NM: So it’s just, like, oh my god, yes. Nichole Moravec 21 1 AJ: Oh, wow. 2 NM: Like, I’m giving people this, like, resource, you know? 3 AJ: Mmhmm. 4 NM: And I just - that’s so awesome. 5 AJ: It’s sort of this space to just be. 6 NM: Right. Or like - like how I was with Alec. Like, meeting someone who’s like that and being like 7 “Oh. That might be me too.” 8 AJ: Wow. 9 NM: Yeah. 10 AJ: So to the extent that you feel comfortable, Nichole - and you’ve alluded toward a little bit, but 11 do you have any thoughts or ideas around - or have you done any medical interventions as a 12 part of your journey, or have any intentions to? 13 NM: Well, I do wear a chest binder every day. 14 AJ: Okay. 15 NM: And that’s about the only extent I’ve gone to. 16 AJ: Mmhmm. 17 NM: I think when I get up to the cities, I’m going to find, like, a therapist that I can maybe start 18 thinking about top surgery with. 19 AJ: Oh. 20 NM: But I think that’s a while down the road. 21 AJ: Sure. 22 NM: ‘Cause I’m kind of fifty-fifty on it. 23 AJ: Yeah. 24 NM: So - 25 AJ: Yeah, you haven’t quite made up your mind yet? 26 NM: Right. 27 AJ: But it’s - it’s in your thought process to a certain extent? 28 NM: Yeah, it’s - it’s just kind of in the back of my head like, oh, that might be something that I would 29 want to do someday. 30 AJ: Mmhmm. Nichole Moravec 22 1 NM: But right now - 2 AJ: Is the binder - I mean I know on some level it - it makes you feel comfortable. 3 NM: Mmhmm. 4 AJ: Is it painful? Is it uncomfortable, physically? 5 NM: Yeah. 6 AJ: Yeah? 7 NM: Well, it - my back. 8 AJ: Really? 9 NM: Yup. Like, when I take it off at the end of the day, it’s just like “Ohhh. Relief.” 10 AJ: Oh, no. 11 NM: But I’ve been - 12 AJ: Bigger relief than taking off a bra? 13 NM: Yeah! 14 AJ: Like, you’ve had the experience of taking off a bra, I assume. I’m making an assumption, but... 15 NM: Yeah. Yup. Yeah, definitely. But I’d rather wear it than not wear it. 16 AJ: Really? 17 NM: Yup. So, most days I can kind of ignore the pain. Or just, like, I’ve been binding for like, a year 18 now. 19 AJ: Mmhmm. 20 NM: So it’s not as bad as it used to be. 21 AJ: Really. 22 NM: It’s like, when you get a new binder - 23 AJ: Mmhmm. 24 NM: I got stuck in my first one. 25 AJ: Oh, wow. 26 NM: Trying to put it on, and I was like - 27 AJ: Were you scared? 28 NM: I was like, “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I’m going to break my ribs!” 29 AJ: Oh my goodness. Nichole Moravec 23 NM: And then I finally got a good, like, hold on it and pulled it down, and then I 1 was like, “Oh, my 2 god.” But, yeah, new binders are so uncomfortable. 3 AJ: Really? 4 NM: Just ‘cause they’re so tight. 5 AJ: Mmhmm. 6 NM: And, like, I knew I had the right size because I sent the company my measurements and all that, 7 so… 8 AJ: Right. Wow. So you bought it online? 9 NM: Yup. 10 AJ: How many do you own, just out of curiosity? 11 NM: I have two. 12 AJ: Mmhmm. 13 NM: So I have a - a half tank top style - 14 AJ: Mmhmm. 15 NM: And then the one I’m wearing today is the full tanktop. 16 AJ: Okay. 17 NM: And that one’s, like, a nude color. 18 AJ: Mmhmm. 19 NM: So...this one is a lot newer, so I have to - 20 AJ: It’s a little tighter. 21 NM: Yeah. I have to pick and choose what days that I want to wear it, to what I’m going to be doing 22 those days - 23 AJ: Mmhmm. Longer days versus shorter days. 24 NM: Yeah. Right. 25 AJ: Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Well, thank you for addressing that question. I appreciate it. 26 NM: Yeah. 27 AJ: Have people been - have there been people who have been really helpful to you in your 28 transition? Beyond Devon and maybe Alec who - I’m not sure if Alec knows that they had this 29 impact on you or not. 30 NM: Mmhmm. Yeah. They don’t. Nichole Moravec 24 1 AJ: Do they? 2 NM: I haven’t told them. 3 AJ: Okay. 4 NM: I should, someday, because I know if someone told me that I’d be like “Thanks.” 5 AJ: Yeah. Do you keep in touch with Alec, then? 6 NM: We’re still friends on Facebook, but we don’t really talk that much anymore. 7 AJ: Mmhmm. Sure. 8 NM: Just ‘cause - 9 AJ: They’re gone, and - 10 NM: We’re both busy. 11 AJ: Yeah. Life is busy, yeah. 12 NM: Yeah. But - well, the first person that I came out to besides Davin was my best friend at the time 13 that I had made in college, Ally. And we were best friends for about, like, four years. 14 AJ: Mmhmm. 15 NM: And throughout that whole four years she was, like, so supportive. 16 AJ: Wow. 17 NM: Always saying “I’m here for you, I’ll stand by you, you never have to worry about me.” 18 AJ: Hmm. 19 NM: “I’m always going to support you.” 20 AJ: Wow. 21 NM: So that was a huge, huge help. And definitely Full Spectrum, too. 22 AJ: Yeah. 23 NM: And the people I’ve met through there. 24 AJ: Hmm. 25 NM: My friend family. 26 AJ: Yeah? 27 NM: Yeah. 28 AJ: So you do have a - a - a chosen family group? 29 NM: Yeah, I do. Nichole Moravec 25 1 AJ: Yeah? 2 NM: Yeah. Really the only person I have a good, like, bond with, family-wise is my brother Davin. 3 AJ: Really? 4 NM: Other than that it’s not too good. 5 AJ: So your mom is not supportive, or…? 6 NM: She’s an alcoholic. 7 AJ: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. 8 NM: So… 9 AJ: She’s struggling. 10 NM: Yup. And she’s - she’s a person who, if she doesn’t understand something, she doesn’t really try 11 to dive in, try to understand. It’s just the, oh, I don’t understand, so… 12 AJ: Mmhmm. So... 13 NM: “Drop it.” 14 AJ: Go away. Yeah. 15 NM: Yeah. So, yeah, that’s definitely tough. 16 AJ: Oh, that’s so tough. 17 NM: Yeah. 18 AJ: Is she in recovery, or trying to seek help or anything? 19 NM: No. Nope. She’s in denial. I don’t think she’ll ever come to terms with her alcohol problem. 20 AJ: Oh, boy. 21 NM: And that’s just something…’cause Davin and I have tried to talk to her about it multiple times, 22 and just ends up into big screaming match, so… 23 AJ: Mmhmm. Yeah. 24 NM: It’s not worth it. 25 AJ: Right. And you said your dad, though - you feel good about your relationship with your dad 26 now? 27 NM: Yeah. 28 AJ: You going to move in with him for a couple months? 29 NM: Mmhmm. 30 AJ: When you go back to Faribault. Nichole Moravec 26 1 NM: Yup. 2 AJ: That’s cool. Well, I’m really glad that you have this chosen family. 3 NM: Yeah. Mmhmm. 4 AJ: Support is so important on this gender journey - 5 NM: Right. 6 AJ: - that many of us have embarked upon. 7 NM: Mmhmm. 8 AJ: So you said it’s - Full Spectrum is a broad LGBT organization? 9 NM: Mmhmm. 10 AJ: What do you think, Nichole, is the relationship between the L, G, B - particularly since you’ve 11 identified as many of them along the way! 12 NM: Right! 13 AJ: What - what is the relationship between those letters in the acronym, and do you think they 14 should remain together? Do you think maybe the T and GNC folks should go off and do their 15 own thing? Like... 16 NM: Right. I definitely think that it’s important to have them together. 17 AJ: Mmhmm. Okay. 18 NM: Just to educate the L and the G and the B, you know? 19 AJ: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. 20 NM: And I have definitely thought about making another, just, like, trans and gender nonconforming 21 specific group. 22 AJ: Right. 23 NM: But I honestly just don’t have the time. 24 AJ: Sure. 25 NM: And - but I think if I did have the time, I would. 26 AJ: Mmhmm. 27 NM: Just so people who fall under that umbrella would have that one space where it’s full of people 28 who are like them, you know? 29 AJ: Mmhmm. 30 NM: Because cis people and trans people have completely different experiences, so... Nichole Moravec 27 AJ: And when I - when I - when we first came in, you asked me if I was going 1 to interview JamieAnn 2 Meyers. 3 NM: Mmhmm. 4 AJ: Did you see JamieAnn on campus a couple weeks ago? 5 NM: Yes. Yes. I’ve interacted with JamieAnn quite a bit, so. 6 AJ: Okay. Cool. 7 NM: Yeah. 8 AJ: Yeah, they did a production with 20% Theatre right here on campus, right? 9 NM: Yeah. Yeah. 10 AJ: How was that? 11 NM: It was awesome. 12 AJ: Uh huh. 13 NM: Oof. I cried multiple times. 14 AJ: Really? 15 NM: Yeah. 16 AJ: Wow. 17 NM: It was, like, happy tears, though. 18 AJ: What do you think the role of art is in gender identity and - and activism, broadly? Is there a role 19 for art, or…? Does art speak to you in a certain kind of way? 20 NM: Yeah. Well, productions like the 20% Theatre and stuff - 21 AJ: Mmhmm. 22 NM: And doing the monologues that they put on - 23 AJ: So I think they did The Naked I here, right? 24 NM: Yup. Yup. And it’s more of a, like, you’re listening to these people’s stories and experiences and 25 connecting to that, and I think that’s really important. 26 AJ: Mmhmm. 27 NM: Especially for trans people who feel like they’re alone. 28 AJ: Right. 29 NM: So I think, in that way, it’s really important. 30 AJ: Yeah. Nichole Moravec 28 NM: Just to make 1 that connection. 2 AJ: Mmhmm. That you’re not alone. 3 NM: Right. 4 AJ: There’s other people exist who have same or similar-type stories. 5 NM: Right. 6 AJ: Yeah. What do you think the agenda should be for the transgender community moving forward? 7 I mean, this is more visibility that trans and gender nonconforming people have had in - than 8 any other time in history that I’m aware of. 9 NM: Right. 10 AJ: But - by the same token, you know, there are bathroom bills, and trans people being murdered, 11 and kids committing suicide - like, what should our agenda be? What should the agenda be? 12 NM: Mmhmm. 13 AJ: In your opinion. 14 NM: That’s tough. I mean, I think starting off with working with trans youth is really important, and 15 something that I really want to work towards - 16 AJ: Mm. Mmhmm. 17 NM: - having a part in, when I explore my activism more, when I move up into the cities. 18 AJ: Sure. 19 NM: Just because kids are mean. And school is hard already, and then with all this bathroom crap 20 going on… 21 AJ: Mmhmm. 22 NM: I just - ugh. I just want to go hug them all. 23 AJ: Yeah. 24 NM: And - I don’t know, I think just starting off with the youth. It’s really important. 25 AJ: Mmhmm. 26 NM: And building up from there. 27 AJ: Right. No, that’s what - that is definitely the future, I think. You know, young kids are coming out 28 so much younger. 29 NM: Right. 30 AJ: And getting support from their families, and getting access to hormone blockers and - 31 NM: Right. Nichole Moravec 29 AJ: - therapy, and all of these kinds of things to really speed 1 up that transition. 2 NM: Mmhmm. 3 AJ: Talk to me a little bit about love and relationships! You’ve been bisexual, you’ve been lesbian... 4 NM: Mmhmm. 5 AJ: I don’t know if queer is a label that you deal with now... 6 NM: Yeah. Mmhmm. 7 AJ: Are you in a relationship? 8 NM: I am. 9 AJ: Yeah? 10 NM: Yeah. And the relationship - 11 AJ: Genderqueer? Male? Female? Binary? Nonbinary? Like, who do you - 12 NM: A cis female. 13 AJ: A cis female. Okay. 14 NM: Yup. And it’s great. 15 AJ: Yeah? 16 NM: Yeah. She - 17 AJ: You guys are in love? 18 NM: Yeah. 19 AJ: Sweet. I love it. 20 NM: Yeah. She’s super supportive and at the same time acknowledges that she doesn’t have my 21 experience. 22 AJ: Mmhmm. 23 NM: And tries to really, like, dive into that, and try to understand. 24 AJ: Mmhmm. 25 NM: Rather than just kind of ignoring it, which is great. 26 AJ: Yeah. 27 NM: Yeah. ‘Cause I was actually in a relationship when I came out as nonbinary. 28 AJ: Mmhmm. 29 NM: And that did not go well. Nichole Moravec 30 AJ: 1 Yeah? What happened? 2 NM: She...basically - well, okay. So I told her one night that I thought that I might be genderqueer 3 nonbinary. 4 AJ: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. 5 NM: And then a few weeks later, she was like, “Okay, well, that’s okay, but if you do come out as that 6 I don’t know if I’ll be able to stay with you.” 7 AJ: Mmhmm. Wow. 8 NM: Well, we ended up staying together for a few months after I came out and it’s… 9 AJ: Mmhmm. 10 NM: Always using the wrong pronouns, misgendering me, we’d get into fights about it all the time. 11 AJ: Mmm. Wow. 12 NM: And it just got to a point where I was - I couldn’t anymore. 13 AJ: Mmm. But this person identified as lesbian? 14 NM: Yes. 15 AJ: Okay. 16 NM: And that was also a big thing. 17 AJ: Mmhmm. 18 NM: Because she was like, “Well, then, now what am I going to call myself? Because I’m not dating a 19 woman.” 20 AJ: Right. Yeah. 21 NM: And I’m like, “I don’t know, you’ve got to figure that out for yourself!” 22 AJ: You weren’t trying to jump in and help with that! Oh, man. 23 NM: Yeah. 24 AJ: But now in - in your current relationship, the lines of communication are... 25 NM: Yeah. 26 AJ: Better? 27 NM: Mmhmm. And that was definitely one thing that I brought up before getting into this 28 relationship, is being, like, “Okay, this is my identity.” 29 AJ: Mmhmm. 30 NM: Like, “This is who I am. You have to respect that 100%, otherwise this isn’t going to work out.” Nichole Moravec 31 1 AJ: True. 2 NM: And right from - right off the back, she was amazing about it, so. 3 AJ: Mmm. 4 NM: It’s awesome. 5 AJ: Are you - or, have you been involved with any sort of male-identified person since your bisexual 6 identity days? 7 NM: I have not. 8 AJ: Yeah? 9 NM: Yeah. 10 AJ: Yeah. Mostly female-identified... 11 NM: Mmhmm. Female, or nonbinary, genderqueer, yeah. 12 AJ: Nonbinary. Mmhmm. Mhmm. 13 NM: Yeah. 14 AJ: I’m - I’m just kind of curious as to - what do - in your experience, what is the differences 15 between being involved with a male-identified person and a female-identified person? 16 NM: Mmhmm. I honestly couldn’t tell you, because I really haven’t been involved with any male-17 identifying people. 18 AJ: Yeah? 19 NM: Yeah. 20 AJ: Okay. Well, there’s the answer to that question. 21 NM: Yeah. I guess I just knew really young that that just wasn’t my thing, so… 22 AJ: Right. 23 NM: Yeah. 24 AJ: No, that’s good. I mean...you’ve got to know yourself, right? 25 NM: Right. 26 AJ: Absolutely. So...you - you got this great job waiting for you at Fastenal, when you move up to 27 the cities. 28 NM: Mmhmm. 29 AJ: What impact has being trans or being gender nonconforming and nonbinary had on your 30 professional life, if any? Nichole Moravec 32 NM: Well, I’m not necessarily 1 out at work. 2 AJ: Okay. 3 NM: Just because...well, here - 4 AJ: So it is - they kind of think you’re a hipster chick, basically. 5 NM: Yeah. 6 AJ: ‘Cause...I don’t know, you don’t take out the piercings and things when you go to work, do you? 7 NM: Super gay. Super gay chick. 8 AJ: Yeah. 9 NM: Which, whatever. 10 AJ: Yeah? You know who you are, right? 11 NM: Yeah, exactly. At the end of the day, I know who I am, and this job is only temporary. 12 AJ: Right. 13 NM: This isn’t my career. So, why go through all that trouble to just - I don’t think anything would 14 honestly change, if I came out. 15 AJ: Sure. 16 NM: And I think it might just make me even more exhausted than I already am. 17 AJ: Yeah. 18 NM: So it’s - it’s just not really worth it. 19 AJ: Right. 20 NM: Yeah. 21 AJ: Yeah. 22 NM: But I think once I’m - once I get a full-time position in the company is when I’m going to make 23 that move. 24 AJ: Mmhmm. 25 NM: To come out. 26 AJ: So how come do you work there now? 27 NM: Huh? 28 AJ: You said you work there now? 29 NM: Yup. Nichole Moravec 33 AJ: Every 1 day, or weekends? 2 NM: I work about fifteen to twenty hours a week. 3 AJ: Okay. Okay. 4 NM: Yeah. 5 AJ: Cool. Any other jobs that you’ve gotten on campus where your gender played a role, or didn’t? 6 NM: Well, I kind of like to think of being co-president of Full Spectrum - 7 AJ: As a job? 8 NM: Yeah. 9 AJ: It is! 10 NM: It’s a lot of work! 11 AJ: ‘Cause it’s a job. It’s a good thing you think of it as such, ‘cause - 12 NM: Yeah. 13 AJ: - that’s what it is. 14 NM: Right. So, yeah, my gender is definitely impacted that one, I think in a positive way. 15 AJ: Mmhmm. Oh, cool. 16 NM: ‘Cause I can be myself on campus. 17 AJ: Mmhmm. 18 NM: So… 19 AJ: Wow. 20 NM: Yeah. 21 AJ: So no negative impacts, really? 22 NM: Well, yeah, kind of. So last year for Trans Day of Remembrance, me and a few of my friends 23 thought that it would be really cool idea to go buy an American flag at Wal-Mart, flip it upside 24 down, and paint Trans Lives Matter on it, and then write all the names of the people who were 25 murdered. 26 AJ: It’s a pretty cool idea! I like it. 27 NM: Yup. And we hung that up in the smack-dab middle of campus on our gazebo. 28 AJ: Uh huh. 29 NM: And that was ripped down, so then we went and bought another one and did it again. 30 AJ: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Nichole Moravec 34 NM: And it stayed up for about...probably a half an hour. Got ripped down again. 1 And then for a 2 week after that, on social media, it was terrible. Hearing transphobic shit left and right, and we - 3 we even got, like, a couple death threats. 4 AJ: Really? Oh, my goodness. 5 NM: Yeah. It got to the point where we had to talk to the president of Winona State because we 6 didn’t feel safe on campus. 7 AJ: Sure. 8 NM: None of us had been going to class or anything who were involved with it, so - 9 AJ: Mmhmm. What was his response - or what was their response? I don’t know, is it a male or 10 female? 11 NM: Yeah, it’s a male. His response was positive. He wanted to ensure our safety, but other than 12 having a conversation about it, nothing really happened. 13 AJ: So the perpetrators - the people who tore down the sign - never were…? 14 NM: Yeah - well - 15 AJ: Identified? 16 NM: Yeah, because they did it on this app called Yik Yak, I don’t know if you know what that is. 17 AJ: I do - it’s the college - yeah. 18 NM: Everyone - everyone’s anonymous. 19 AJ: Right. Anonymous. Yeah. 20 NM: Yeah. So - yeah. Never found out who did it. 21 AJ: Mmm. 22 NM: Yeah. 23 AJ: Wow. Yeah. Are they still using Yik Yak on this campus? 24 NM: Yeah, I think so. I think it’s more of a freshman thing. 25 AJ: Yeah. 26 NM: I don’t have it, just because of...disgusting. 27 AJ: Yeah, it’s kind of - people just say whatever, and they don’t have to own up to it. 28 NM: Mmhmm. Right, exactly. 29 AJ: Hmm. Well, is there anything that I haven’t asked you, Nichole, that you feel like is really 30 important? And before we get to that, let me ask you this. 31 NM: Okay. Nichole Moravec 35 AJ: You know, because, I don’t know, 1 you’re - twenty one? 2 NM: Twenty three. 3 AJ: You’re twenty three? 4 NM: Mmhmm. 5 AJ: You identify as genderqueer - like, where do you see the future of the trans community in the 6 next fifty years? 7 NM: Fifty? 8 AJ: Yeah. 9 NM: Oh, wow. I just see it expanding more and more. 10 AJ: Uh huh. 11 NM: Because before it was just kind of trans female, trans male. 12 AJ: Mmhmm. 13 NM: And now I feel like genderqueer, nonbinary, genderfluid is kind of getting more visibility. 14 AJ: Sure. 15 NM: So I just see the community growing a lot more, getting a lot bigger. 16 AJ: Mmhmm. 17 NM: And...hopefully the trans visibility will be positive. 18 AJ: Yeah. 19 NM: And ‘cause - past couple years, the murder rates have been outrageous. 20 AJ: Mmhmm. 21 NM: And they’ve just been getting worse and worse. 22 AJ: Especially for trans women of color. 23 NM: Yeah. 24 AJ: Yeah. 25 NM: And...oof. 26 AJ: Mmm. 27 NM: I just hope that that’s not a continuing trend, though in reality, we know that it’s probably going 28 to keep happening, sadly. 29 AJ: Well, I mean, I think we - we have to fight to - to change that. Nichole Moravec 36 1 NM: Right. 2 AJ: Right? 3 NM: Right. 4 AJ: Yeah. Well, I really appreciate this opportunity to sit down and - and have a moment with you, 5 Nichole. 6 NM: Yeah. Yeah, I appreciate it too. 7 AJ: And hear a little bit of, you know, your journey, and - and your joys, and your challenges. Thank 8 you so much. 9 NM: Yeah. Thank you. 10 AJ: Until we meet again. 11 NM: Yeah. 12 AJ: All right.
