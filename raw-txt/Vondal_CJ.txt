Is your school… 3 4 CJV: Uhm, I actually only came out to my school, like my high school, as a lesbian. I actually came out 5 in a newspaper article. It was during the— 6 AJ: As a lesbian? 7 8 CJV: As a lesbian during my junior year of high school. 9 10 AJ: Mhm. 11 12 CJV: It was the, it was for the, it was called the Same Sex Couple Marches Down for like our Prom. 13 14 AJ: Uhuh. 15 16 CJV: And during that time my partner was actually gender fluid. 17 18 AJ: Okay. 19 20 CJV: And, and it was then that I kind of started to notice that I didn’t really fit like feel like a woman. 21 Like a started like looking up things… 22 23 AJ: Mhm. 24 25 CJV: … for like trying to figure out what my identity was… 26 27 AJ: Sure. 28 29 CJV: … but I just kept as a female but I wasn’t really comfortable. 30 31 AJ: Mhm. 32 33 CJV: So… 34 35 AJ: Wow. Uhm, do you have any plans for medical interventions as a part of your transition? 36 37 CJV: I hopefully, I want to but the only problem is I have to deal with, uhm, polycystic ovary 38 syndrome, PCOS, which leads sometimes if it’s not treated can lead to ovary cancer and, uhm, I 39 think it’s pelvic cancer too. 40 41 AJ: Mhm. 42 43 CJV: And I was actually diagnosed on my eighteenth birthday, which was one day after I actually told 44 my mom I wanted to transition. 45 46 AJ: Okay. 47 CJ Vondal Interview 6 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota CJV: So the day I was told I had PCOS they— my mom was like, “Well you have to 1 wait and see if you 2 can at least try to balance your hormones.” 3 4 AJ: Right. 5 6 CJV: Cause PCOS is pretty much a, uh, hormone disbalance. 7 8 AJ: Okay. Alright, uhm, so thinking about medically transitioning but really want to make sure that— 9 10 CJV: … that my— 11 12 AJ: … your body can handle… 13 14 CJV: … handle it. 15 16 AJ: … yeah, that’s smart. That’s very smart. Uhm, what do you think of the Dismantling Walls 17 conference this weekend? 18 19 CJV: It’s actually— I’m, at first I wasn’t coming… 20 21 AJ: Uhuh. 22 23 CJV: … but then I’m like, “Well, I have no other plans…” 24 25 AJ: [Laughs]. 26 27 CJV: So I’m like, “Well, I might as well register.” And I’m actually enjoying it. I’m actually talking to a 28 lot of people and actually opening up to them. 29 30 AJ: Uhuh. 31 32 CJV: I’m usually actually really shy, closed kind of guy so… 33 34 AJ: Oh, I can’t tell. You’re, uh, pretty, uh, active and engaged since I’ve met you. Uhm, do you come 35 to Fargo very often? 36 37 CJV: I do not. It’s actually been almost a year since I’ve been to Fargo. 38 39 AJ: Mhm, mhm. 40 41 CJV: Last time I was here was for like, uhm, I think it may be a year, maybe two. I can’t really 42 remember but it was when, uhm, this trans activist came and it was during that time that I 43 started to notice like I actually like understood what he went through. 44 45 AJ: Mhm. 46 47 CJV: And I started to realize that, that’s what I kind of wanted to do too. CJ Vondal Interview 7 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: So I’m getting a theme that when people show up in, in these communities and they’re living 3 their lives authentically like that can have an impact on people. 4 5 CJV: Yes, it does. 6 7 AJ: Yeah, I mean, how did that impact you. 8 9 CJV: It kind of gave me the strength to be the person that I want to be. 10 11 AJ: Uhuh. 12 13 CJV: Like I was always like shy, and I didn’t want to come out to my parents. 14 15 AJ: Right. 16 17 CJV: Like the first time I came out as lesbian I actually had an argument with my mom… 18 19 AJ: Mhm. 20 21 CJV: … cause she was actually afraid for me. 22 23 AJ: Sure. Yeah. I mean, understandable. You know there’s a lot of bigotry and hatred out there and 24 so parents worry. Yeah. But you’re being brave. 25 26 CJV: Yup. 27 28 AJ: Uhm, CJ is there anything that you want to say that I didn’t ask you? 29 30 CJV: Mm, not that I know of. 31 32 AJ: Okay, what— last question— what do you think is the number one issue facing the transgender 33 community? 34 35 CJV: I, uh, I think it’s just how people treat the trans community. 36 37 AJ: Mhm. 38 39 CJV: Like with the H2BE [correction: HB2] law in North Carolina. 40 41 AJ: Mhm, mhm. 42 43 CJV: It’s kind of harmful to everyone cause if you read it they actually mess up what, what sex means. 44 45 AJ: Right. 46 47 CJV: And so it’s kind of harmful. CJ Vondal Interview 8 The Transgender Oral History Project Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies University of Minnesota 1 2 AJ: Well, it also, uhm, limits people’s ability to sue the government for discrimination. Uhm, all 3 people, uh, immigrants, people of color, uh, I don’t think people realize that when they voted to 4 pass this thing, uhm, so, yeah, you’re absolutely right. It, it has an impact on all our lives. 5 6 CJV: Yeah. 7 8 AJ: So I want to thank you so much for being a part of this conversation and this project and wish 9 you good luck in your college career and your journey towards becoming more and more 10 yourself, CJ. 11 12 CJV: Thank you. 13 14 AJ: Thank you so much.
