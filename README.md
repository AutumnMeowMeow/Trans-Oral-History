Description from [the project website](https://trettertransoralhistory.umn.edu/curated-films/project-info-and-curator-bio/):

<blockquote>"The Tretter Transgender Oral History Project (TTOHP) is part of the <a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/tretter">Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection in GLBT Studies</a> at the University of Minnesota Libraries. The Tretter Collection has approximately 3,500 linear feet of material about GLBT history around the world.

Transgender voices and experiences are often missing from contemporary documentation and historic record. To help fill in the gaps, the Tretter Collection proposed an ambitious three year project (2015-2018) to add oral histories from transgender and gender queer individuals throughout the Upper Midwest.

The goals of the TTOHP were to empower the Upper Midwest Transgender community while providing students, historians, and the public with a richer foundation of primary source material about the Transgender community. The oral histories, and donations of new collections, joined existing materials within the Tretter Collection where they are accessible to all users free of charge.

The TTOHP (Phase 1) is made up of 200 unique stories which can be found on the University of Minnesota Libraries website here. This website is an online installation of theme-based film selections from the archive and represents only a small glimpse into the full project. We hope it inspires you do dig deeper into the stories, experiences and knowledge of the full interviews.

We are deeply grateful to all of those who helped make this project happen including Tawani Foundation and our other donors and supporters. But, most of all, to those who shared their stories with us.

We are proud that the success of Phase 1 has resulted in a commitment to create a Phase 2 of the Project. This next phase (2018-2020) will look at policy, community organizing and political activism. We will explore how – in an era with unprecedented focus on transgender issue – how trans lead, GLBT, and mainstream organizations are responding to the challenges, who is setting the agenda and how partnerships are evolving."</blockquote>
