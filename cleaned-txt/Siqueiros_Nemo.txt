Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
Andrea Jenkins -AJ 
Nemo Siqueiros -NS 
AJ: So good afternoon. My name is Andrea Jenkins, and I am the oral historian for The Transgender Oral History Project at the Tretter Collection at the University of Minnesota. Today is October 14th, 2016, and I am in the bear city of Fargo, North Dakota. [Laughs]. Fargo, North Dakota. And I’m here today with Nemo S… 
NS: Siqueiros. 
AJ: Siqueiros. I had it down and then I lost it. 
NS: [Laughs]. 
AJ: Uhm, Nemo Siqueiros. Nemo, uhm, thank you for being willing to sitting down with us today. And I just want to have you state your name. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: Spell your name… 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: … so that we make sure that it’s pronounced correctly and spelled correctly. Also state your gender identity today, how you identify yourself, your gender assigned at birth, and the pronouns you use. 
NS: Mhm, got it. My name is Nemo Siqueiros. N.E.M.O. like the fish. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: Last name. Siqueiros. S.I.Q.U.E.I.R.O.S. like the muralist. And my, I currently today identify as trans male with the pronouns he and they. 
AJ: Wow, that’s awesome. 
NS: Mhm. And I was assigned female at birth. 
AJ: Thank you so much. Uhm, wow, you think about the transgender journey and then your name is Nemo, I mean, you can’t help but think about Finding Nemo. 
NS: Right. 
AJ: You came to this name, right? 
NS: I did but not in the way that you might think. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Okay, please explain it. 
NS: I actually had a friend, Annie Witcher. She’s a beloved friend of ours at the station as a volunteer. And she asked if I got the name because clownfish are able to change sex in their lives. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: And, I was like, I did not honestly know that but that is a very interesting fact. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Okay. 
NS: But the reason I chose it was because when I was in college I was learning about my indigenous identity… 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: … and how that colonialism has taken away, uhm, a lot of history and historical concepts for gender identity. When colonialism happened in Mexico and the Americas, uhm, they killed a lot of my people in their conquest… 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: … especially, uhm, third gender, non-binary folks. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: Mhm, and so, uhm, the only term that I know of for third gender who, uhm, identified more femininely are Muxe of the Zapotec in Mexico. 
AJ: Mhm. How do you spell that? 
NS: Muxe is spelled M.U.X.E. 
AJ: Yes. I’ve heard that term. 
NS: And there’s like whole communities— 
AJ: And where are they from in Mexico? 
NS: Uhm Zapotec. 
AJ: Zapotec. 
NS: Yeah, those tribes, and, uhm, there’s like whole communities of those folks there that are highly respected and considered like a blessing in that community. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: And, you know, I really appreciate that in my family that I’m also considered a blessing. 
AJ: Really? 
NS: Right. Yeah, not in the same, uhm, terminology because I’m okay with right now for the term of trans man. 
AJ: Sure. 
NS: Mhm. So, uhm— 
AJ: But the feeling, the acceptance, the reverence, if you will is similar or the same. 
NS: The acceptance is there. Right. But to get back on track in terms of my name and choosing of it. I was doing research about that, and we were meeting about the months of the Aztec calendar and how those days are split into thirteen-day weeks. And those thirteen-day weeks are split up into, mmm, roughly twenty day months, which cycle through all these twenty-day simples. It’s really elaborate… 
AJ: [Laughs.] 
NS: … but because I studied it I know how it works and I know what the symbols mean that I could tell you what you could expect on a given day, kind of like divination and how that works. 
AJ: Wow. So this is an Aztec calendar? 
NS: Yes, this is the Aztec calendar, which is also inspired by the Mayan calendar who are the predecessors, and what I learned was there was a period in that two-hundred and sixty day ritual calendar, which is different from the three hundred and sixty-five that they also had. 
AJ: Mhm. Oh wow. Okay. 
NS: So there was a period of time between one ritual calendar and the next, a period of five days called Nemontemi, which basically means evil, bad, barren days, and it would be unfortunate if a child where born in this period and sometimes parents would wait to name their child after the days had passed so that they could give the child a proper name and a good blessing to go off with instead of bad luck throughout their life. 
AJ: And it’s a two-hundred and sixty day period? 
NS: It’s a two-hundred and sixty day— 
AJ: So there are a lot of kids born in that period. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: Right. For example, if you are born on the day of five jaguar you might be named Maquineosodo [Spelling may be incorrect]. And that’s how you would say five jaguar. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: And, uhm, while I was reading, I— they got to the period, at the time the book was written by the, uhm, Sakagoon [Spelling may be incorrect], that’s the guy’s name. Uhm, he talked about, in the period of January when I was born, uhm, that that period was Nemontemi at that time. Now I was born on the day of the Maquineosodo but I really highly identify with that name in that book because they named, uhm, children during that period Nemontemi. If they were female they would name— 
AJ: [Spelling term out]. N.E.M.O.T.I.M.I.? 
NS: T.E.M.I. Yep and, uh, they would name them, the men Nemoquichtli and if they were women they would name then Nemcibuatl, which is basically just kind of the different terms that are like the suffixes at the end for male nemo and female nemo. So I just shorten it to Nemo because of my gender identity. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Oh okay. 
NS: And, technically you would pronounce it Nemo [‘e’ pronounced like the ‘e’ in end] but I make it easy and I don’t really mind the pronunciation if you say Nemo [‘e’ pronounced like the ‘e’ in easy] but that’s the actual origination of my name of choosing. 
AJ: That’s fascinating. Thank you for sharing that. Uhm, Nemo, what is your earliest memory in life? 
NS: Earliest memory in life [thinking]. I remember like lots of things, pieces. Uhm, I, well most of my fun memories begin when I was like three, and I was raised in that hot Disney era in the ’90s. Right? And, uhm, I was raised on these concepts of gender identity and what girls should be like. Right? And then, uhm, when I discovered anime, the separate cartoon genre I started looking at women in a different way in terms of what they are capable of because the Disney era showed me that women were like damsels in distress to be saved. Whereas anime showed me characters of women that could also be heroes in their own right. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: And then I also started to identify more strongly with male figures in these cartoons. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And as I grew up I started not caring what I was dressing in. It actually started before that because my grandfather before I was born, uhm, he got a nice deal, something like that, like ten cents for a bunch of baby clothes. 
AJ: Mhm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: And in there was not only dresses but overalls, shorts, shirts, didn’t matter. They didn’t know the gender of the baby, didn’t care. It was a good deal that they had. So my mom was just like, whatever, and, uhm, we had a joke about this and I mentioned this on one of my radio shows. Uhm, that she was laughing when I was helping her make her bed, and I asked her, “What’s so funny?” 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: And she said, “No, it’s kind of mean. I can’t tell you.” I was like, “No, no I can take it,” I tell her. And then she says, “Well, when you were born I thought you were kind of an ugly girl.” 
AJ: Oh, no. 
NS: And I said, “But I’m glad that everything turned out okay cause I’m a boy, cause I make a better boy than I do a girl.” 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: And she tried, when I was growing up and being raised as a girl at the time, she got me the frilliest dresses possible, tried to do up my hair, but, generally, I just didn’t look right. I looked better in overalls and shorts. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: It just looked better. My face just didn’t work out for the feminine look. 
AJ: Huh, okay. Did it feel better? 
NS: It felt better to me especially as I grew older, like okay, these dresses are nice but I often get cold and I need something to cover my legs. 
AJ: Yeah. [Laughs]. 
NS: So I can’t really deal with the skirts right now unless I have leggings maybe. And then, uhm, after that I was just kind of like, “I’m just gonna do away with the skirts and the dresses.” Cause it’s just not my aesthetic, and then I was feeling, like, “I really like the idea of the classy look, like hats or sombreros” like I brought in today. Or, uhm, suits, ties, and stuff like that. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: So, and that was kind of my aesthetic, and, uhm, I’m also autistic so I already didn’t dig into the concept of gender binary in traditional gender roles. 
AJ: Right, right. 
NS: And, so, in some areas, I was ostracized for that or made fun of or bullied, etcetera, etcetera. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Mhm. Where did you grow up? 
NS: I grew up in, let’s see. I was born in Iowa City, Iowa, and I remember the m
AJority of my childhood was in North Liberty, Iowa. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: I grew up there until I was nine-ish uhm, through elementary school before I moved to— 
AJ: Liberty, Iowa. 
NS: North Liberty, Iowa. 
AJ: North Liberty. 
NS: Yeah. 
AJ: How big of a town was that. 
NS: It’s kind of small I guess. I guess it was small because my mom would take me out to other cities like Coralville, Iowa which is like one of the m
AJor quad cities, I think… 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: … if I recall correctly. She would also take me to places like Des Moines or Quad Cities itself, uhm, Chicago, which was just over the Mississippi river. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: So, or visit my grandfather in Muscatine, Iowa. Wait, I take it back. I also lived in Muscatine before I lived in North Liberty. And, at that time, we lived in this house and I had a dog, which really helped with a lot of anxieties that I had as a child. And, uhm, then when we moved to North Liberty, we had to give her away. So it was just kind of heartbreaking for me, a traumatic experience. 
AJ: Oh. When did you begin to realize, when did you first realize that, “I may not be the gender that everybody thinks I am”? 
NS: That’s the thing, like, for the longest time I had assumed I was cisgender, right? And it was only in high school that I was becoming aware of my sexual identity and then in college my gender identity. But then in hindsight I think about all the foreshadowing of my total, like, I don’t care about how I dress sort of thing. 
AJ: Mhm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: Uhm, and I realized that it was probably as early as, mmm, I’m gonna say, like five, six? Uhm, when my sister’s father had accidentally left the door open to the bathroom, and I turned around real fast like, “Oops, sorry about that,” you know. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: That was an accident but I had seen enough, like, wait a minute, he goes to the bathroom differently. 
AJ: Yeah. [Laughs]. 
NS: And that was my first inkling of like, “Why can’t I do that?” 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: And so I was under the expectation, like, maybe one day I can get there or I can go to the bathroom like that. And, then, of course, it just never happened. So that’s like my earliest like thought of like, “I don’t feel right in my body...” 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: “… Maybe I’m supposed to go in that direction.” 
AJ: So you mentioned you were sort of harassed, bullied, teased in school. Was it all around your autism or did your autism sort of help to create gender dysphoria or disassociation. 
NS: More or less. I think, like, I, with autistic people they just don’t care about what other people think. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: And that’s how I’ve always been. I don’t care at all what society thinks. I think that’s what drives people crazy. But also, uhm, with autism I see the truth a lot quicker. Like, I acknowledge that there is no such thing as a gender binary and that it is in fact fluid… 
AJ: Right. 
NS: … and can constantly change, like the water changes shape or size etcetera. And, uhm, I think that because of the way I view the world and interacted with it that was part of my bullying, and, uhm, because of the anxieties that I received from bullying, I had a lot of unfortunate accidents. 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: Like the earliest memory I have was I got beat up by some kids when I was like seven, eight maybe… Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: … when I was living in North Liberty. And I wanted to hang out with them and ride bikes with them, and they beat me up and stripped me and everything. 
AJ: Oh no. 
NS: Mhm. My mom was livid. 
AJ: Yeah! Absolutely. Did she— did the kids get in trouble? 
NS: They got in trouble, and I’ll leave it at that but she took care of the situation. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: And since then she’s like constantly protected me whenever she needs to and, uhm, carefully let’s me know that, while I am an adult, I can seek out help from her. And when I feel like I want to ask her… And I never let people tell me that just because I’m an adult now doesn’t mean that I can’t ask my parents for help. 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: Especially when people want to take advantage of me because, “Oh, you’re an adult. Just make your own decisions.” Well, my decision is that I’d like to consult my mother… 
AJ: Right. 
NS: … who actually care about me. 
AJ: Yeah, that’s my decision. 
NS: She usually has my best interests at heart. 
AJ: Mhm. Absolutely. Siblings. Do you have brothers and sisters? 
NS: I do. I have my sister, uhm, from another father but otherwise she is, uhm, I actually asked for her, that’s the funny thing. Like, I was like maybe four or five when I told my mom I want a sibling cause I’m all alone. 
AJ: Awe. Yeah. [Laughs]. 
NS: And, uhm, then my mom came along with my sister, and it’s like great. And I took care of her. I helped change dippers. I was very attentive of my sister as she grew up and then of course once she started moving around talking I just kind of like distanced myself from her. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: You know, classic sibling, like, “Okay, you know what? I’m bored of you. 
AJ: Right. [Laughs]. 
NS: And, uh, but now that we are both adults, my sister and I, uhm, we get along much better. She’s homeschooled which makes me a little bit more easier to talk to her because now she has a different education and she talks about more interesting things than what the school system was telling her. And she’s just like easier to be around because we actually have stuff to talk about and have in common. 
AJ: Mhm. So just the one sibling? 
NS: Just the one. And then after that though we have extended siblings that live in South Carolina. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: Unfortunately, I haven’t spoken to them in like a year or two only because of the current situation between her father, his wife, and the extended family beyond that. 
AJ: Did— so you didn’t grow up with those guys though? 
NS: Not too much. With those siblings I knew them up until like, let’s see, uh, maybe ten? Like the oldest child was ten, and I have two other siblings. I have, let’s see, my brother, my other little brother who was like, mmm, fourteen now. It’s like, it’s a little foggy only because I haven’t seen them in a while, but I know that he’s no longer ten. And uh, from the last I saw him, then I have my other little brother, the middle child. And then my youngest sister. And we just haven’t seen each other or spoken to each other in a while but it’s not that I have anything against them. It’s because of the strange relationship I have with their own mother so… 
AJ: So when did you come out… 
NS: I came out… 
AJ: … as a trans person? 
NS: I came out in in college because I was having a struggle with, uhm, part of it was my weight. Uhm, I’m a little bit overweight by some standards but I also want to acknowledge that, like, you know, I can be a plus size guy but I also don’t want to be unhealthy, you know what I’m saying? 
AJ: Right. 
NS: So part of it is the balance between healthy and happy… 
AJ: Mhm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: … in my body. And so I come out to my mom about my gender identity, and she was instantly like, “Cool, whatever,” you know, “Let’s— we’ll get you transition socially.” And it took a while for her to stop calling me by my birth name and into my new social name. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And same thing with my sister. And then it took a little bit a while to get the rest of the family to follow along. And the thing is within, uhm, Mexican cultures that we have many nicknames for our family members that do not match our birth names anyways. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Right. 
NS: Right. And— 
AJ: So it wasn’t that big of a stretch for people. 
NS: Right. It shouldn’t be. At least with my grandpa. My mom had a conversation with him one day, and she tells the story, like, uhm, how he had asked, “Does he still insist on calling him Nemo?” And it’s like, why does it matter? We have so and so who calls himself this but their name is really this. And this person has been called this all their life, and I never knew their name originally at all. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Oh wow. 
NS: Why is it relevant now that we call Nemo, Nemo? Why does it matter, regardless of gender identity? 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: Maybe he just wants to call himself as a nickname. Why does it matter? 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: And so that— 
AJ: That’s what your grandpa said? 
NS: Well that’s what my mom said. 
AJ: That’s what your mom said to your grandpa. Oh okay. 
NS: Right. Right, to clarify. And so he was like, “You’re right. You’re right.” And, you know, backed off on that. And so now like the last time he visited me for my college graduation he called me Nemo for the first time that I can remember. And I was just like, “Good. He’s learning.” [Laughs]. 
AJ: So when were you in college? I don’t, I don’t know. Last week? Last year? Eight years ago? Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: I graduated from high school... I literally just graduated a month and a half ago this August. 
AJ: Okay, so I was pretty close. [Laughs]. 
NS: Yeah. And cause, it took me five years to get through college because I fell a bit behind and every now and then I had like a depressive episode or something, you know? And it’s partly seasonal because like, you know, the winter always gets me down. Like where’s the sunlight? 
AJ: College is tough. And it gets chilly here in Fargo, huh? 
NS: And it gets chilly. Yeah. 
AJ: Lots of snow. 
NS: Lots of snow, and like because I also have like scoliosis in my back and everything. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: I already have a hard enough time lugging all my school textbooks. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: And even though I only had to go to MSUM in Moorhead and go like a couple blocks back to my house, it was still a pain in the butt… 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: … to go from there to there with some icy sidewalks or neighbors who were just like “Whatever, I won’t shovel my sidewalks today or ever.” [Laughs]. Cause I have to like trench through that and I’m just a tiny little Mexican kid just [Laughs]… 
AJ: So, wow, I’m listening to you, Nemo, and it’s, it’s becoming clear to me, I mean, your walking is packed with really multiple, sort of intersecting identities. 
NS: Yeah. 
AJ: You identify as, uhm Latinx or Mexicana. 
NS: I still with the indigenous Michoacán [Possibly wrong term @ 22:50] cause that’s where I come from. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: And Latinx is like, you know, come from another word for those from Latin America but my ancestors come from Mexico. 
AJ: Okay. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: And because my family is from north and south Mexico I come from Puebla tribes and Michoacán, which are the original Aztecs. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: And the Aztec name is from is the name from Aztlan, which is from the North American region at the four corners. 
AJ: At some point I might have to get you to write down some of these words… 
NS: Yeah. [Laughs]. 
AJ: … that you’re throwing out here cause, uh— 
NS: It’s part of my anthropology stuff… 
AJ: Yeah, absolutely. 
NS: … that I was taught in college. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: Cause— 
AJ: I don’t want to stop you from using that language but I just want to make sure we get it accurately reflected in the transcripts. But what I was trying to say is so, so Mexican, can I, can I use that? 
NS: Yep. 
AJ: Okay, uhm, disable or, I don’t know if you identify with that but you talked about autism. We talked about scoliosis, uhm, and trans. Like, that— And then at to that you have been in some pretty white communities. 
NS: Oh yeah. [Laughs]. 
AJ: So how, how does that impact your life? How does that affect your life? 
NS: One really easy one can start with, “Can I touch your hair?” 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And of course that just kind of like crosses into a line of weirdness because, first off, as an autistic person, I don’t like being touched. Period. 
AJ: Right. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: Especially if you’re not my family. 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: So, at that, it’s just like, “No, you cannot touch my hair just because you’ve never seen a Mexican before, you know? 
AJ: [Laughs]. Right. Uhuh. 
NS: Or, uhm, “Can I hug you?” It’s just kind of like now you’re crossing some line that I’m not quite comfortable with quite yet unless I really know you well like family. 
AJ: Sure. Uhuh. 
NS: Uhm, and, even with white people, it becomes strange because it’s hard to have a relationship with white people, whether it’s friends, uhm, family, or potential people that I want to be romantically involved with. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And, of course, with, uhm— I watch my mother who’s married to a white man. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: And I’m learning from her— 
AJ: So you have white people in your family? 
NS: Oh yes. Yes. Now we have— I have a white father so to speak. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: And, you know, uhm, we enjoy taking out that card because people like to pretend that they have their black or their Mexican friend. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And it’s just like but are they really your friend in your life? 
AJ: Right. 
NS: And I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t appreciate using you as a token, right? 
AJ: Yeah. Absolutely. 
NS: And so we just have our token white guy. [Laughs]… Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: … to pull out. And we train each other and support each other in our own anti-racism training to support each other as a family. 
AJ: Is that right? 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: That’s awesome. 
NS: Mhm. And so that strengthens us as a family cause there are constant forces that are pulling us a part whether it’s his white side of the family, which is understandable. I mean, we just met a relative, uhm, who was surprised that any of his family members would end up with a Mexican… 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: … at all. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: And so that was kind of a joke in of itself to learn about. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Uhuh. 
NS: And it’s like, well this one did and he’s learning. It’s been a hard road, but we’re still going. And, little by little, we, uhm, we teach other white people about the effects of white supremacy and how in this system we’re not meant to be friends or family. We’re not meant to be interacting with each other and that’s why white people are so isolated. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: So now it’s just bringing white people into our lives telling them our stories that they don’t get to hear. 
AJ: Does adding trans identity into this mix, uhm, I mean, what have been some of the challenges since you’ve come out as trans? 
NS: Just vaguely passive aggressive things. Kind of like, uhm, I remember us I was talking to a classmate briefly about it. Like, I was starting to use my name Nemo in the classroom and within my social circles that I interacted with because I was a volunteer at the Rainbow Dragon Center at MSUM… 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: … which was the LGBT center. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: And, uhm, this guy had called me by my new name several times, and I didn’t hear him because I’m not used to my new name at that time. 
AJ: Right, right, right. 
NS: You’re still, you’re still adjusting yourself, you’re transitioning. 
AJ: Yeah, yeah. 
NS: And, you know, and then he called me by my birth name, and I was like, “Did you just”— [Laughs]… 
AJ: Oh wow. 
NS: … give me a moment. 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: And then like, uh, understandably I was just not mad at first but then he’s like, uh, “How can I call you by the name you want if you’re not going to answer to it?” And it’s just like, “Listen, you think this is hard for you but it isn’t. It’s hard for me.” 
AJ: [Laughs]. Exactly. 
NS: I’m still getting used to this transition myself… 
AJ: Right, right. 
NS: … so you don’t have to be all, you know, pissy about it. 
AJ: Uhuh. Wow. 
NS: Yeah, so just little things like that. Otherwise it’s been mostly smooth. 
AJ: Really? What about school in general? I mean, like the administration and the teachers and the professors? 
NS: In general? Oh, the teachers and the administration has been the most understanding about my gender identity, but they have not been understanding of my Mexican identity. 
AJ: Really? 
NS: And that’s just a whole other story in and of itself. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Uhuh. So you’ve been having a hard time because of your racial background than… 
NS: Exactly. 
AJ: … your gender history. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: In high school it was both my autism because they were trying to take advantage of me when I was turning eighteen and also of my Mexican-ness, even though I was a queer person that they were messing around with at that time. 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: And I talked about that in a coming out story that I aired a couple of weeks ago. 
AJ: Yeah, it’s national— well this is National Coming Out week, I guess. I don’t know. 
NS: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. 
AJ: The day was earlier. What was your coming out story? How did you come out? 
NS: Uhm, I came out as a senior in high school. I had, uhm, I had realized that I was attracted to not just men aesthetically but women as well. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And I was just kind of like, “Okay, I guess this is happening. I’m not straight as I once thought.” 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: And, uh, then I, I was signing up every year to be part of the high school plays. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And there’s like this whole high school click thing, right? But it goes deeper than that. It’s not just the high school. It’s also in the community itself… 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: … cause of those kids and their parents and who their connected to. 
AJ: Mhm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: So in my senior year I was finally chosen for a role, and I played the lesbian professor in the Laramie Project. 
AJ: Oh, really? Wow. 
NS: Right. Yeah. 
AJ: That’s a big play. 
NS: Yeah. It’s a big play, and I had a few lines but it was enough, and, uh, then they started like posting homophobic posts and, uhm, other awful posts. And then they were— 
AJ: About the play or about you? 
NS: About the play. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: I wasn’t out to my fellow students at that time yet. I was only out to my family. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: And then, uh, I was watching this unfold, and I was just kind of like, you know, cause its high school. You just want to stay to the side and just lay down low. You don’t want to like rock the boat. 
AJ: Right, right. Rock the boat, yeah. 
NS: Right. And so like, “Okay, just relax. You’re gonna be okay if you can just get through this. Last semester of high school, you’ll be okay.” And then I wasn’t okay because one of the students decided to pretend to be an angry student wanting the Westboro Baptist Church to picket the play cause they had messaged them saying that. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: And I was just like, “Are you freaking kidding me?” I’m just gonna pray they don’t answer that email. They didn’t! 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: And I was like, “Okay, good. I’m safe.” And then another student decided to pretend to be an angry parent about the propaganda play, and this time they received an answer saying they would picket the play. And I was just like, “What?!” [Laughs]. “Are you serious?” 
AJ: So the play attracted the Westboro Baptist Church? 
NS: Because the students contacted them pretending to be, you know— Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: angry parents or whatever? 
NS: Yeah. Yeah. 
AJ: And they came? 
NS: No, they did not come… 
AJ: Oh, okay. 
NS: … because at that point I was like, “Okay.” So I took snapshots of all these posts and everything. Showed my mother, like, because she has a paralegal background. She was also at the time the editor of the High Plains Reader. 
AJ: High Plains Reader? 
NS: Yep, yep. 
AJ: Okay. 
NS: And then I was like. “Mom, I am in great danger. This community is in great danger because these children have invited a hate group to our community. 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: And she was not down with that either. So we went to the media and told our story of what really was happening. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And at this point in time these kids were already on the media themselves telling their side of the story about how— they basically openly admitted that they, in fact, hoped they would come. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And it was just like, “Why would you hope they would come? Do you not realize that we have a queer community that needs to stay safe?” 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: It was disgusting. 
AJ: Yeah, absolutely. 
NS: And, uh, then I said, “This is a hoax. You’re, you know, you’re all being hoodwinked here.” Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Mhm. [Laughs]. 
NS: And, let me tell you, I have the evidence to prove that they brought them here. Nobody didn’t like that, and I had angry messages telling me, “Why are you exposing this? These kids are getting threats and blah, blah, blah, blah.” Well, it’s like, they shouldn’t have done that then… 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: … if they didn’t want to, you know, like, if you don’t want me to say anything mean about you, don’t do anything mean in the first place… 
AJ: Right. Uhm. 
NS: … cause most people will write nicely about you. And then, like, uhm, I had to have an assistance principal escort me during the play. She didn’t do a very good job cause these students decided to pretend that they’ve been my friends all along when that’s never been the case. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: I’ve always been this weird, vaguely queer autistic kid. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: You know? That’s also Mexican while all these other kids are white… 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: … and involved in the Trollwood Theater Community in this, you know, town. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And now they’re like, “Hey, you’re costume looks great.” And it’s like, “Oh, now you’re my friend, huh? I don’t believe you.” So we didn’t want the assistant principal escorting me anymore cause obviously she wasn’t going to stop these people from talking to me… 
AJ: Right. 
NS: … cause that’s kind of vaguely threatening when they can just talk to you. And then I had to have an officer escort me. And that’s when the kids didn’t talk to me, and I was like, “Great.” 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And also the first night some kids in the front row tried to heckle me, and that’s when I had blanked out, you know, on my lines. 
AJ: Oh wow. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: And, like, I wanted to die in that moment. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: You know, that embarrassment of stage fright. 
AJ: Sure. 
NS: And then eventually I remembered my lines. During this time when these kids were heckling me my mom was like having like a whisper shout match with the superintendent, Lowell Wolf. 
AJ: Uhuh, oh wow. 
NS: And, uhm, she was recording him because that’s her right to record… 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: … as long as she knows about it, and he was like just not being helpful at all to the situation. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: Eventually he retired after that along with the other superintendent, and the thing is that if you understand how the school system works, when you’re a super intendent, it’s like a judge. You don’t want to retire until you’re like dead. [Laughs]. Pretty much… 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: … because of how well it pays. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: But this guy retired. So did the other guy quietly a few months later. And, uhm, yeah after that the police had to escort me for the remaining nights that the play was going. And after that I just couldn’t deal with the idea of going back to school in person so I was home tutored, and my teachers from school would come see me. 
AJ: Oh wow. Is that when you came out then or? 
NS: Probably, yes because no one in town or in school knew that I was queer up until that point when it’s like, “Oh, Nemo tattled on the cool kids,” sort of thing. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: Right? 
AJ: Wow. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: And that’s when I came out as bisexual at that time. Now I identify as demisexual so. 
AJ: Say more about that. Demisexual. 
NS: Demisexual is kind of like a trust thing. Uhm, it’s kind of under the asexual umbrella where you definitely could get romantically involved with someone but sex is just not on your top priorities unless you really bond with that person of interest. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And then you’re just kind of like, “Okay, yeah, I could be down for sexy times, you know, with that person.” 
AJ: So if you’re in love? 
NS: Yeah, part of it is love and also the trust. 
AJ: Trust. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: So a combination of love and trust. 
NS: Right, like it can’t be, like some people they can handle a one night stand. Me, I can’t fathom the idea. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: And, you know, to each their own. 
AJ: Got it. Are you in a relationship right now? 
NS: [Takes deep breath]. 
AJ: A romantic relationship? 
NS: Uhm, at a distance. It’s low key. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: It’s low key right now. And, uhm, I’d like, you know, to meet them one day to like, you know, make it a real thing. 
AJ: So it’s an internet romance? 
NS: It’s an internet romance. We’ve known each other as friends for like six years… Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Oh wow. 
NS: … and then some. And we’ve have our on and off times. So nothing new there. Uhm, it’s about as realistic as it gets in terms of relationship cause yeah we’ve had arguments but we’ve also had our good times along with the bad times. And so— 
AJ: But you guys haven’t met yet? 
NS: No we haven’t but we’ve like face chatted and talked to each other over the phone in the past. Texts, emails. And, you know, we’re both artists too so we sometimes send each other, you know, images and because of the lack of representation of LGBTQ folk in media we often come up with our own original characters to pair up together… 
AJ: Huh. 
NS: … and write stories about them. 
AJ: Wow. So, uhm, you work in media? 
NS: Yes. 
AJ: What do you do? Tell me about this. 
NS: Well currently I am working at KPPP-LP Fargo-Morehead 88.1 FM Radio. 
AJ: Uhuh, KBPB? 
NS: PPP. 
AJ: PPP. 
NS: Yep. 
AJ: Okay. [Laughs]. 
NS: Yep, three P’s which stands for the People’s Press Project. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: They also work with Mexi DashCam which is a Mexican, uhm, web blog site that talks about indigenous and Mexican news. And, uhm, also, uh, what else do we work with? Mexi DashCamm People’s Press Project, yeah, I think that’s it. Otherwise I’m forgetting something. 
AJ: So you have a radio show? 
NS: Yup, I have a radio show which is Finding Me. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: What’s it called? 
NS: Finding Me. 
AJ: Finding Me. 
NS: Yeah, and I come up with, like, a lot of the slogans and designs and stuff for all the shows and programs at our station. Like I came up with Finding Me because, uhm, it’s a queer centered show, and it’s about finding yourself, but I’m also the host and my name is Nemo. So you’re finding Nemo on the air. 
AJ: Okay. [Laughs]. There you go. 
NS: So, and I like making inside jokes like that. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: And I came up with the slogan for our radio station which is, “Adding local color to your airwaves.” 
AJ: Nice. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: I like that. 
NS: Yep. 
AJ: Is there a large Mexican community here in Fargo? 
NS: I don’t know. That or it’s really quiet… 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: … under, you know, all the white noise, you know what I’m saying? 
AJ: [Laughs]. Another little under the radar pun there. 
NS: Right? Uhuh, right? 
AJ: I caught that one. [Laughs]. 
NS: So I also like word play, like the whole concept of adding local color to your airwaves is that with radio you can only hear… 
AJ: Mhm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: …. but if you’re adding a little color you get a visual. Uhm, local color can mean both in terms of imagery, uhm, local color in literature refers to, uhm, the dialect of someone’s voice whether they have a southern drawl or if they have a midwestern accent or a western accent— 
AJ: Or Fargo. Yeah sure. 
NS: Right. Or if they sound stereotypically Minnesotan… 
AJ: Uhuh. 
NS: … uhm, etcetera. And so local color can refer to the literature that you read in a voice and so you can actually hear it. And, so, with that we cover the concept of hearing, uhm, immigrant voices and their accents, and I think about how it must be a challenge to know two languages, your home language and also, uhm, learning English in this nation… 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: … to get around. Uh, and also local color can mean, like whether you’re a person of color. Local color can mean whether you’re part of the colorful rainbow of the LGBTQ community. 
AJ: Yes. 
NS: Right. And also just, you know, color can mean diversity too. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: So I wanted this to have as many meanings as possible… 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: … and as few words as possible and so therefore we are adding local color to your airwaves. 
AJ: … to your airwaves. Got it. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: Uhm, Nemo, to the extent that you feel comfortable discussing this, tell me what medical interventions you have accessed on your journey to become Nemo? 
NS: Well… 
AJ: …. to becoming. 
NS: Well for the longest time I did not know I was autistic but my mom kind of always knew. 
AJ: Mhm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: And for the longest time, up until I was twelve years old, uhm, she was trying to get an official diagnosis of my autism. The thing is, as I understand it cause I’ve done studies about it, has been that one, it’s very hard to get a diagnosis for a person of color… 
AJ: Hm. 
NS: … because it’s more diagnosed highly in autistic white boys. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: For some reason, it’s just easier to detect. We don’t know why. 
AJ: Hm. 
NS: Second, when you’re assigned female at birth for some reason it’s normal for a girl to be withdrawn as autistic people tend to be but it’s abnormal for boys to be withdrawn because they’re supposed to be outgoing, rambunctious, you know? 
AJ: Right. 
NS: And so it’s just not picked up earlier in women. 
AJ: Mhm. So it’s racist and sexist. 
NS: Exactly. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: That’s the funny thing about psychiatry. 
AJ: The lack of diagnosis. 
NS: And so when I was around, let’s see, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, in those ages, uhm, I was moving back and forth, elementary, middle school, or whatever between my step-mother and my sister’s father who were married at that time, and my mother. My step-mother, who is a pediatrician for children, uh, she had us like label whatever, like really fast. And it was assumed that I was like ADD or whatever, which was not the correct diagnosis and that my sister was ADHD and that also was not the correct diagnosis. Uhm, and during the summer, we were on heavy medications. They gave me ditropan for my bladder because of my anxiety issues… 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: … and that was because of bullying at school. And, of course, when you have that sort of trauma, you’re gonna urinate. It’s just gonna happen… 
AJ: Mmm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 1 
NS: … when you have that trauma. And, uhm, I was also on concerta to help me concentrate, which apparently was a heavy dosage, and I cannot recall what the third medication was but I was on three different medications. 6 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: And when school started up again that’s when things went downhill cause I just could not cope even with the medications. And that’s when I started having these episodes of suicidal ideation… 
AJ: Mmm. 
NS: … where I was… I don’t remember a whole lot only cause it was a drug fog. That’s how bad it was… 
AJ: Sure. 
NS: … that I did crazy, insane things that would be considered violent. For someone who’s been pretty gentle all their lives is just totally out of character for me, and that’s when my mom knew something was wrong, like very, very wrong. So she had me sent to Prairie St. John’s here, and they assessed that I was autistic. I don’t need to be on any of these medications, and, as long as I’m not, you know, driven to so much anxiety that I urinate myself then I would be fine. 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: And that’s what it came down to. And I remember in my therapy sessions that like, you know, uh, I remember first off that I had to stay overnight for a month. I had to stay there the whole time. I could not go back home. 31 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And I was upset with that because I miss my mom. And, uh, my step-mother and my sister’s father flew up here really fast because of what was happening and how they could be liable for the heavy dosages that they had given me… 
AJ: Oh wow. 
NS: … when they could have easily just gone and got a proper diagnosis from the beginning. And, uhm, it was at that time I remember the counselor asking me, like, “Well, what if you fall in love with someone or something?” And I was just like, “Well, I guess.” And at this point I was off of the medications and I guess it was just enough rational to let me think, “Well maybe I can just live a little bit longer.” [Laughs]. And, uh, so then that’s when I started adjusting and, uhm, transitioning out of a fog into, like, “Okay, I think I’m going to be okay.” I mean I still am depressed but it’s a lot more manageable when I have my family support. 
AJ: Sure. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: And, uhm— 
AJ: So how did that impact, you did it because you were taking those medications, you decided not to do hormones or any kind of medical intervention? 
NS: It’s not, the only reason I haven’t had, like, medical interventions in terms of, like, hormones is because I actually want to have children first before I get into that. 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: And, uhm, cause I was reading about the effects of testosterone on the body and whether or not you can still technically be on it if you were looking to get pregnant. And it’s like, “Okay, well it looks like you still can get pregnant but it’s not recommended. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And these are the experiences of others that studies on trans men who are on testosterone, and then I recently read a story, an article, about a trans man who chose to get off hormones to get pregnant with his wife, and then, uhm, have a child and then go back on hormones slowly afterwards. 
AJ: Hm. Wow. 
NS: And so I was like, “I think I’ll go that route.” And— 
AJ: Was his wife a trans woman or did they have artificial insemination? 
NS: I believe they had artificial insemination so, uhm, I was thinking to myself, “Yeah, I can wait.” And I’ve also read stories on social media, like, Tumblr is, like, a heavy site where I didn’t notice that a lot of LGBTQ folks there. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: Where they’re just openly, like, affirming themselves. Like, “Yes, I’m gay, like one-hundred percent, a hundred and twenty percent, etcetera” 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: And lots of internet memes that I can laugh about about the LGBTQ experience or the Mexican or the black experience that others face , and, uhm, that’s where I learned that, “Listen, you don’t have to be in a hurry to get on hormones if you’re a trans woman or if you’re a trans man and if you identify that way.” 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: It’s not gonna be too late, ever, to go on hormones. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: Mhm. That’s true. Absolutely. 
NS: Some people chose not to. Some people do, and that’s up to you to figure out on your own. And reading messages like that made me feel a whole lot better about myself as well as my mom talking about carefully mapping out my life. Like, this is what your options are. This is what will happen if you take this route. And I want you to be mindful that, yes, you could have top surgery but a lot of doctors are not really experienced in top surgery, especially in our area. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And in this period of time. 
AJ: So talk about your area a little bit. Uhm, Fargo. What’s the queer community like here? What are resources like for trans identified people, particularly seeking medical access to medical care? 
NS: To be perfectly honest I don’t really know a whole lot but when I came out as bisexual in high school, that’s when I became aware of the LGBTQ community a lot more prominently. Starting with the Pride Collective, Joshua Boschee, who was at the time, uh, a writer for the High Plains Reader who wrote about my story when my mom was not allowed to even though she was the editor of the High Plains Reader. 
AJ: Oh wow. 
NS: He stepped up to the plate, and I’m glad for it. And, like, you know, I’m really happy right now that he’s also pushing, uhm, for representation in North Dakota, and those bills that he’s working on. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And, uh, I’m eternally grateful to him, uh, stepping out and helping me out in my journey and sending the information and resources here in the Fargo-Moorhead community starting at the Pride Collective. Uhm, other than that my only experience has been through my uncle Raul who is openly gay in this community. 
AJ: Okay, wow. 
NS: And, like, he’s kind of like a party frat guy. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: Even though he’s like thirty-something or other. 
AJ: Yeah. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: But because of my social demeanor I’m just not that party guy so it’s just kind of like— and from his perspective— 
AJ: So is he your wingman, kind of like or you’re his wingman? 
NS: I would say— Something like that. I don’t know. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: But like I’ve gone to a few parties with him and stuff like we recently went to his birthday back in January or whatever and that was, like, the last party I went with him to but he goes to other parties for his friends. And I’m just not into the whole party scene. I’m more like chill out at home with a drink kind of guy. 
AJ: Yeah, is there a lot of clubs here in the Twin Cities— I mean in, well they are twin cities, Fargo­ Moorhead, I guess. 
NS: Well, I guess. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: Uhm, there are some places you can go to but, uhm, like some popular places that I hear my uncle go to is the Aquarium, Dempsey’s, and those are just two that I knew off the top of my head. 
AJ: But, I mean, are there trans friendly places to go. 
NS: That I cannot say because I have not heard very good stories from my beloved co-host, Darcie. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: So, uhm, and that’s been her experience and so I’m just gonna take her word for it and just kind of be like there’s not really a place for us at the moment so… 
AJ: [Laughs]. Alright. Wow. So it’s a little hostile here… 
NS: A little bit, yeah. 
AJ: … in Fargo? 
NS: So most the time, you know— 
AJ: Have you been harassed, I mean have people, like, blatantly? 
NS: Nah, most of the— like, first off as a Mexican I never go anywhere alone without my family. 
AJ: There you go. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
NS: Especially without my white father. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: He could just step in and be, like, “Are you messing with my kid?” 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: “My Mexican child?” [Laughs]. 
AJ: Yeah. Right. 
NS: So he steps in, like, that, right, right. 
AJ: Smart move. I need to get me a white father. [Laughs]. 
NS: [Laughs]. Right. Exactly. For example, he was cool enough, like, uh, last Halloween to walk me and my sister just to make sure everything was cool because he lives in a white neighborhood so we live with him, right? 
AJ: Right. 
NS: And so, just to be sure that none of the white folks get scared of the Mexican kids in candy skull makeup freak out, he comes with us and someone can be, like, “Yeah, he’s our dad.” [Laughs]. 
AJ: Yeah. [Laughs]. 
NS: And it’s not like we’re lying. He’s married to our mother so therefore he’s our father. 
AJ: Right. [Laughs]. Yeah. Wow. Uhm, have you ever worked for an LGBT organization. 
NS: I volunteered and I’ve gotten a scholarship from PFund. 
AJ: Okay, wonderful. Congratulations. 
NS: I, well, it’s an old scholarship at this point because that’s how I got into MSUM. 
AJ: Yeah. 
NS: Cause I told them about my high school story and they were like, “Heck, give ‘em the money.” [Laughs]. 
AJ: Right. 
NS: “They deserve it.” Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: I actually used to be a grant reviewer for the scholarship fund for PFund. 
NS: Oh, yeah? Cool. 
AJ: So, I know that they get a lot of really great applications so that’s why I’m saying congratulations. 
NS: Nice. Right, yeah, yeah. 
AJ: Yeah, no, that’s awesome. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: Wow. Uhm, so, uhm, you’ve done some volunteer work. What do you think, Nemo, the future is like for the transgender community? 
NS: I would like to hope that it gets brighter for us because, uhm, up to this point, the community has been focused on the “G” mostly. 
AJ: Yep. 
NS: Sometimes the “L.” The “B” gets quieter. The “T” is silent. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: And then after that it’s just nothin’. You don’t hear much about that. And especially in this community is especially focused on, uhm, the gay scene. So, and that’s all I hear about and that’s why I try to talk about those who are not heard on my show. 
AJ: Mhm. Lift up those voices. 
NS: Lift up those voices. I don’t censor them. I let them tell their stories, and, you know, I learn a lot because I don’t identify with those sexualities or gender identities. 
AJ: Mhm. 
NS: But I learn. And I hope others are learning as much as I am. 
AJ: That’s an amazing platform that you’re creating for, uhm, communities and marginalized, uhm, voices. 
NS: Yeah. 
AJ: Wow. 
NS: Mhm. Nemo Siqueiros Interview 
AJ: That’s awesome. Nemo, is there anything that you want to share with me that I didn’t ask. 
NS: Uhm, I can’t really think of anything. I mean, you really covered a lot of my life story. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
NS: So I’m just like I can’t even think, that’s a lot. [Laughs]. 
AJ: Ah. 
NS: But, no, I can’t think of any questions that you could ask that I could answer right now. 
AJ: Yeah. Well, I again just want to say thank you so much for, uhm, being willing to share your story and your voice and add your perspective to this project but to the world more broadly. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: So, uhm, thank you and, uh, until we meet again my friend. 
NS: Mhm. 
AJ: [Laughs].
