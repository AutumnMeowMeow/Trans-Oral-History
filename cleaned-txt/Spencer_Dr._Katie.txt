Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
Andrea Jenkins -AJ 
Dr. Katie Spencer -KS 
AJ: So good morning. 
KS: Good morning. 
AJ: My name is Andrea Jenkins. I am the oral historian for The Transgender Oral History Project, uh, at the University of Minnesota. Today is February 29th, 2016. It’s Leap Day. 
KS: Yeah. It’s Leap Day. Cool. 
AJ: Yeah so this is sort of a unique day. 
KS: [Laughs]. 
AJ: I am sitting here, uhm, having a discussion with, uhm, an esteemed, uh, academic here at the University of Minnesota Katherine, Dr. Katherine Spencer. And Dr. Spencer, uh, works at the Center for Sexual Health, Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota. And so, Dr. Spencer, this is uh, a departure from, uhm, most of the interviews that we have been doing at— up to this point in time but I think it’s a good, uhm, a good departure. We’ve done fifty-two interviews to date… 
KS: Wow. 
AJ: …with trans and gender non-conforming people. And so I felt like it’s a really good time now to take a step outside of the lived experiences of, uh, trans and gender non-conforming people to talk to, uhm, a professional who has spent their, uhm, their academic career and their professional career thinking about working with talking to, uhm, transgender individuals. Uhm, and thinking about the issues that affect those communities. Uhm, and, and how the future of transgender health is progressing. So with that long introduction… [Laughs]. 
KS: [Laughs]. 
AJ: … I’m gonna ask if you can introduce yourself, state your preferred gender pronouns, state your gender identity as it is today, and, in keeping with the questions that I ask all of my other, uh, participants to date, what was your gender assigned at birth? 
KS: Okay. Uhm, my name is Katie Spencer, and I prefer she and her pronouns. Uhm, I identify as a cisgender woman and a femme. Uhm, female identified. And I was assigned female at birth. Is that everything or… 
AJ: Uh, you were assigned female at birth? 
KS: Right, I was assigned female at birth. 
AJ: Yeah. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: And I identify as a female and as a woman. 
AJ: Awesome. [Laughs]. Uhm, one of the questions that I have found helpful to get us sort of in a reflective mood is can you tell me what is the earliest thing you remember in life? 
KS: The earliest thing I remember in life? Just in general? 
AJ: Yeah, earliest memory. 
KS: Oh god. That’s actually really hard. Uhhh, just to get reflective, early memories. Uhm, I don’t remember like a time from when I was, like, really little but I guess I remember around the period of time when I was, like, four, five, like that comes to mind. I lived in Farmington, Missouri, which is like a small town [laughs]… 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: … uhm, south of St. Louis, Missouri. Uh, and so I have a lot of memories of, like, living there in Farmington, and like, hanging out with my brothers and, you know, just like playing. I used to like catch frogs and [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: I really love frogs. 
AJ: Wow. 
KS: And like ride my bike and hang out with my dad and like play house with my brother and like [laughs] stuff like that. 
AJ: Wow. 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: Cool. Uhm, so, uhm, pretty typical middle America upbringing you would say? 
KS: Uhm, I guess. Yeah. Yes. I, you know, lived in, in the Midwest. I moved around a lot when I was a kid. So I remember when my parents got divorced when I was like nine or ten and so there was some… I mean, I guess, that’s typical for like half of people, right? [Laughs]. 
AJ: Okay, yeah. It is. 
KS: Yeah and moving around a lot. I feel like I know a lot of people who stay, like grew up in one place. Uhm, and I don’t know. Like, moving around a lot like, you know, like, for a period of time I moved like every like eighteen months. 
AJ: Wow. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: You know? And so I think having moved a lot and like been in different places, all in the Midwest, uhm, so like shaped by that. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: But, uhm, and shaped by sort of like, midwestern white suburban culture. You know, that was like part of my experience but, uhm, that moving around like I had to like sort of figure out how to like be, uh, an observer of like different social groups and how to like get into that. [Laughs]. So I don’t know that’s something that has served me well. 
AJ: Oh cool. Cool. So, you know, I, I mentioned that, uhm, this is a bit of departure and just to be real clear, you, you don’t identify as a transgender person? True? 
KS: No, yes, I do not. 
AJ: But, you know, one of the things that we, we sort of laughed about prior to rolling our cameras is that everyone has a gender identity. 
KS: Mhm. 
AJ: So when did you recognize your— when did you first recognize your gender identity? 
KS: Oh, I love that I get to talk about this. It’s fun. Uhm, uh, well, I mean, I was always aware. I talk about this all the time cause when I do education and training and teaching I always talk about how everybody has a gender identity, and it’s one of the things, like, here being part of the medical school when I talk medical students and teacher providers that I really want them to be aware of that we all have a gender identity, that we all have a sexual identity. Cause I think cis people and heterosexual people don’t think of that, they just sort of take it for granted. 
AJ: … take it for granted. 
KS: Right. And I think around, like, gender identity, you know, in particular, you know, like… 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: … sometimes people will be like, “Oh,” they recognized different sexual orientations but don’t recognize their own cis-ness. 
AJ: Yes. 
KS: So for me when I was a little girl I was super feminine and, like, female identified. So like I refused to wear anything but dresses. 
AJ: Wow. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: I would get into my, uhm, great grandmother’s, like, makeup shit, like white powder and red lipstick. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: And my future self— 
AJ: That’s so great though. 
KS: I knew what I wanted, uhm, and so, like, there’s this story in my family that, like, on the first day of kindergarten I, like, showed up and I, like, put my grandmother’s makeup on. Uhm, and I was like… 
AJ: Is that right? [Laughs]. 
KS: … I’m ready for school. Yeah. It may or may not be true, but it makes for a really good story. 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: Uhm, and I remember, yeah, I just remember, like, really being, like I identified with girls and like having all other girlfriends. You know, I had like a lot of guy friends like in high school but that was like a different thing. Like just always, you know… Uhm, and I talk about this a lot with friends too that like I think my gender identity, like being very like femme or— I didn’t have language for like femme at the time… 
AJ: Mhm. Mhm. 
KS: … or conceptualization of my queerness like in high school around puberty. Uhm, but I knew that I felt very woman and female identified and that my body felt like congruent for me. But I was fat. I was like a chubby kid. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And so like the intersection of sort of like fat phobia and like that femininity ideals of being like thin… 
AJ: Ahh. 
KS: … especially growing up in like primarily, primarily like white middle class, middle, you know, midwestern America. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: You know, so like being really thin, and this was like the nineties. 
AJ: Right. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: So it was like, you know, Kate Moss kind of business. 
AJ: Yes. [Laughs]. 
KS: Uhm, but that, so that femininity was sort of like off limits for like fat girls. Like that that somehow made you not feminine or like if you were to appear feminine. Like that that intersected also with like sexuality like sort of like a brazenness around sexuality. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: So I think all of those things were like percolating for me and really about when I was eighteen and I discovered feminism and I was like, “Oh yay! That makes sense to me! Yay!” 
AJ: Okay. Right. [Laughs]. 
KS: Uhm, and then like figuring out like, you know, body positivity, fat positivity. And then like in college like getting into like gender studies and being a huge feminist and an activist and like coming out as queer. 
AJ: Oh wow. 
KS: All of that stuff intersected so I think, uhm, this is like… I graduated from college in ‘99. 
AJ: Huh. 
KS: And I remember in my psych of women class, uhm, so when I was like twenty. So it was like ’97. It was 1997. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Uhm, my teacher brought in her friend who was part of the Transsexual Menace. 
AJ: Oh wow. 
KS: And she had a Transsexual Menace t-shirt on, and she was like fierce as fuck. She was amazing. 
AJ: Okay. It wasn’t Riki Wilchins? 
KS: No, it wasn’t Riki. This was in Madison, Wisconsin. 
AJ: Okay, uhuh. 
KS: So it wasn’t Riki Wilchins. 
AJ: Who was the, sort of… 
KS: Right, right. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: … identified founder of, or self-identified founder of Transsexual Menace. 
KS: Yeah, yeah. 
AJ: Yeah. 
KS: Yeah, but I remember meeting her and her like coming to talk to my entire class and just being like woah. Like she was so great and the way that she talked about like gender and sexuality and like trans issues, that was really I think a point, one of the first points where I feel like I was moving more towards that. And I didn’t like know as many… I don’t think I knew trans identified people at that time at least to my knowledge but I think coming out as queer and then expanding that, like then I had more friends who were like genderfluid, genderqueer, uhm, sort of more, like, my family, my chosen family sort of expanded to include that. So I think me being aware of my own gender identity and like, uhm, you know, identifying as femme and getting involved in femme organizing and like queer organizing. That’s like— I think my language evolved over that time. But it’s, I think I was always aware of being very like femme identified from when I was like little. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Oh wow. 
KS: And that was pointed out, you know, just in my family. You know, cause my mother— I have brothers and I have two brothers and my mother was like kind of not into feminism and not into like girly girl feminist stuff. 
AJ: Right. Yeah. 
KS: So it was always like different in some ways. I got push back about that. 
AJ: So you felt a little at odds with your sort of fam— familial structure? 
KS: Yeah, yeah. 
AJ: How many siblings? 
KS: Well I have two brothers. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Uhm, an older brother and a younger brother so I’m in the middle. And then I have, uhm, step­ siblings too so. But I’m not as close with them. I didn’t grow up as much with them. 
AJ: Sure. Are any of your siblings queer identified or otherwise? 
KS: No, they like super straight white cis men who work in like, you know, capitalist infrastructure. [Laughs]. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: But they’re very nice. They try very hard. 
AJ: Uhuh. [Laughs]. 
KS: [Laughs]. They work in like, uh, IT in like computer stuff. They live in St. Louis, Missouri. 
AJ: Okay. So your family is still in Missouri? 
KS: Yeah, most of my— my dad and my mom, even though they don’t live together. My dad lives in Cape Girardeau, Missouri which is like south. It’s— 
AJ: Cape? 
KS: Cape Girardeau. 
AJ: Girardeau. 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: You might need to spell that for my, uh, transcriptionist. 
KS: [Laughs]. Oh, no. It’s Cape. C.A.P.E. Girardeau. G.I.R.A.R.D.E.A.U. 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: Cape Girardeau. It’s French. It’s on the river. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: Anyway, yeah, they all live in Missouri. 
AJ: Cool. Uhm, so, uhm, where did you go to college? 
KS: Uhm, I started at going to Southeast Missouri State… 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: … which is like a very— it’s in Cape Girardeau cause my parents were divorced and I lived with my mom in Wisconsin at the time. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And my dad wanted me to live down south with him so I lived there for two years. That was really hard. I didn’t have any friends. [Laughs]. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: Awe. 
KS: Felt like a weirdo. 
AJ: Awe. 
KS: It was a very small town and like very conservative. 
AJ: Uhuh. Wow. 
KS: And then I went to Madison. So I transferred to the University of Wisconsin in Madison and finished up my time there. Uhm, and then I did my PhD in Counseling Psychology at the University of Missouri, Columbia… 
AJ: Hm. 
KS: … which is like a, it’s like a town, it’s in the middle of Missouri. It’s like the state— it’s like the University of Minnesota of the Twin Cities. 
AJ: The big… 
KS: The flag ship school or whatever. 
AJ: Okay, uhuh. 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: Uhm, when did you realize you wanted to understand and work with the transgender community? 
KS: I think it started, I mean, I tell this story whenever we interview postdocs here that, you know, I forget what year it was. Like second or third year of grad school. So I started grad school when I was like twenty-two so I was like twenty-five… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … I don’t know what year though. I’d have to do the math. Whatever. 2002, 2003. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: Uhm, uh, I sent Eli Colman an email… 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: … and I said, “What do I need to do to get a job there?” Like, you know. 
AJ: Okay. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: Like I’ve looked, I wanted to work in like gender and sexuality studies so I was like getting, I mean, I was queer identified. I was in queer community. I wanted to work with like LGBT community in some way. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And I was really into like sexuality… 
AJ: And you… Uhuh. 
KS: … sex education. What were you going to say? 
AJ: No, I was just going to interrupt you and say, “And you were a smarty-pants and you knew you wanted to pursue a doctoral.” 
KS: [Laughs]. I knew what I wanted, yeah. I think, well I started with the master’s program and then I did, as part of my master’s program I worked with my advisor, Roger Worthington, who is awesome. He’s at, uh, he just moved. I think he’s in Massachusetts now. Anyway, uhm, so oh, Maryland. Uh, anyway, but so I did this climate study. This was back when— Sue Rankin who actually did, was part of the first like trans discrimination survey. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: You know, she, and I think she’s on the second one too that they just finished. She’s like a researcher. 
AJ: Yes, I just did a panel with Sue. 
KS: Oh wow. Cool. Well she did— this was back in like the early 2000s. She was doing like LGB, like climate studies at like different universities. And so we did that at the University of Missouri, and that’s what I did my master’s thesis on was like about like sort of coming out and experiences around coming out and campus climate. And so as part of that my advisor was like, “Have you ever thought about getting a PhD? You should do that.” And so I was like, “Okay.” And so then I applied. So yeah, but that’s how I ended up doing that. And I realized that I wanted to do my PhD or my dissertation on gender. Like I was always just like fascinated by gender. Part of it was about like my own gender process but then also just having like, uhm, gender non-conforming and genderqueer trans people in my life, you know? Just like friends and, uhm, partners and people I was close to so— and this was, you know, I think there was a lot of like activism around that at the time like critiques of the DSM… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual which has the diagnosis at the time. It was called Gender Identity Disorder. 
AJ: Right. And what was the critique around that? Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: Uh, the critique was just that it, you know, placed, uh, transgender people as a disorder you know. Uhm, and so the new term is Gender Dysphoria. So it was like naming sort of the incongruence and the distress around physical body and internal gender identity but in the past, like, and the way that it was written in the DSM was just like pathologizing and didn’t have the input of any trans people like when they made up the diagnosis. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: And like all the treatment at the time… I mean this was, in the early 2000s it’s still really was like more dominated by a like medical model pathologizing like, uhm, hierarchical. You know there wasn’t like— there were activists like getting organized to push back on some of those things but not a lot of it had gone through completely. 
AJ: Mhm. So, at, so in the early 2000s, uhm, some of the more common things that people know about gender transitioning, uh, were still in effect like the life tests… 
KS: Oh yeah. Gosh yeah, I would have to even like, which— so the Har— it was still the Harry Benjamin Society, I think, at that time. 
AJ: Mhm. Yeah. 
KS: Uhm, and the standards of care, uh, yeah, I don’t even know which version— I would have to go back and look. See this will be good because it will be but, uhm. 
AJ: Yeah, right, exactly. 
KS: Uhm, I mean just as a graduate student, me being involved in like activism and challenging that, I wasn’t as fluent in that conversation, but yes it was like a real-life test. Like you had to live for a year or two years to like get hormones or get surgery. Like there were all these sort of like gatekeeping like barriers and not a lot of analysis or critique of like how that placed a burden on trans people to have to navigate these systems and like yeah. 
AJ: Mhm. And I know a lot of people think, you know, a lot of trans identified people , uhm, felt like, uhm, they were compelled to, uh, conform to a certain sexual identity as well as a gender identity. Can you, can you talk a little bit about that. Like— 
KS: Yeah, well, there was, I mean, I think, my, what I’ve heard cause I’m like, I love history of things and I know this, that is part of the history of this place. There was like a panel, like you had to go in front of a panel of providers… 
AJ: Right. 
KS: … and just even meeting with like a therapist, they felt like you had to present yourself to conform to sort of the norms of like normal femininity or normal masculinity... 
AJ: Right. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: … and what’s mapped onto that is heteronormativity so like people were like you had to, you were expected to sort of be heterosexual. 
AJ: Yes. 
KS: And it’s reflected in the research a lot too which is like people were just like fascinated with trans people’s sexual— who they were having sex with. Like in the DSM like you had to like the diagnosis you had to, uhm, signify if you were a transsexual attracted to men or to women or to both. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Why was that part of like the diagnosis? 
AJ: Right. Exactly. [Laughs]. 
KS: Anyway, so yes, there was lots of like pushback against all that stuff. And, I’ll just add, I mean, I think it’s a big part of, you know, what we’re trying to do now of like this gender affirmative or trans affirmative developmental models so it’s about across the lifespan and a component of that like one of the m
AJor like foundational structure of like that model that we have here is about pleasure based sexuality that, you know, trans people deserve to have or have an inherent right to have like pleasurable sexuality, full expression of sexuality. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: So I think there’s been an obsession with like sexual orientation identity and then there’s been like a focus on like, uhm, STI stuff, like sexual transmitted infections and HIV stuff. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: And there hasn’t been as much work, I’m thinking about like how do people, how do trans people experience their bodies and negotiate sex and have pleasurable, great sex with people. [Laughs]. 
AJ: Mhm. Right. 
KS: So that’s one of the things we’re trying to do now is like— 
AJ: So that’s what this trans affirmative or gender affirmative model— 
KS: That’s one of the components, yeah. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Yeah, there’s four components. That’s just one of them. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: Yeah, so what are some of the other ones? 
KS: Uh, the other, there’s the beyond the binaries so that we see gender as a spectrum, as a full spectrum and there’s, you know, people are everywhere on there and so, uhm, and that, that’s great and lovely and part of the natural like full expression of gender identity. Uhm, and then, you know, your gender identity can be different than your gender expression and it’s usually like a mix of things and that’s cool. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: We’re cool with that. That’s great. 
AJ: Yes. 
KS: [Laughs]. We want to support that. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: The other part is gender literacy. So in that like lifespan model too that we believe that gender is— becoming literate or having a critical consciousness about like gender norms and like how gender functions in society and what our gender identities, and that everyone has one. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: And that like how society is shaped around gender like gaining a critical consciousness and skills to be able to name that… 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: … is a powerful tool for trans people and cis people. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Uhm, and so that is something that we practice here is like, you know, talking to people about those things. Uhm, and that that can, uh, foster resiliency to stigma. So if you could name like certain oppressions like sexism and trans misogyny and like all of this stuff. If you can name it and see it and, you know, then that will help you be more resilient to it. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: You know, because you’re like, “Okay, like that’s something that’s happening. It’s not me.” 
AJ: Right. 
KS: “It’s not my fault.” 
AJ: This is, this is the world. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: Right, right. 
AJ: It’s not, it’s less internalized I would say. 
KS: Right, right. So beyond the binary gender literacy, uhm, pleasure based sexuality and, oh this is embarrassing I’m forgetting the fourth one. You’d have to like look in the article. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. Okay. 
KS: Oh, what’s the— I think, oh! It is, it is resilience, resiliency to stigma. So that’s another thing, like just looking at like minority stress, so the impact of like, uhm, multiple oppressions so, you know, being a part of different— like how your identities are experienced within the world in a world that is white supremacist and heteronormative and, you know, classist and like all the different oppressions and how that effects people’s experience of the world and like their health outcomes and like supporting people to be resilient to those things. 
AJ: So it sounds like it’s, uhm, intersectional approach… 
KS: Mhm. 
AJ: … to understanding gender identity. Uhm, how, how prevalent is this model or is this theory— 
KS: Or is it just making it appear. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: Uhm, well that model— 
AJ: … in the boarder movement for transgender health? 
KS: Uhm, I actually think it’s like gaining traction. I, uhm, and more and more people are seeing it that way so it’s not that, uhm, like everybody is, uh, but my hope is that’s more and more how people are thinking. I think like the current like research themes or the current like, uhm, practice themes. So there’s people who do research and there’s people who do clinical practice and some people do both. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: But, uhm… 
AJ: You’re one of those people who— 
KS: Well supposedly I’m both but I’m way more of a therapist. I’m more of a clinician than I am a researcher. So we’re trying to like, we’re actually trying to do like this lifespan— We’re trying to put all those things into practice here and then look at like what are the outcomes for people over the long-term for that. So we’re doing more of that here. But so I think that the minority Dr. Katie Spencer Interview stress model. Uhm, definitely is getting more traction. I think people are thinking more intersectionally. Uhm, and different facets, it depends on where you’re coming from. Like I think that public health does like a good job. I think counseling, psychologists do a good job of talking about that. Like they’re sort of based more on looking at that. So having a more biopsychosocial approach. Uhm, you know, that there’s these different facets and different layers that effect individuals’ experiences within the context. 
AJ: Hm. 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: Wow. Uh, do you have plans to publish this theory? 
KS: That’s what we’re trying to do, yeah. 
AJ: Yeah. 
KS: Yes, definitely. Diane and I are, Diane Burg who runs the Child and Adolescent Program here, uhm, she and I have been working on it trying to write it up. Uhm, we’re developing like new measures. So one of the things that like, uhm, there’s some existing measures. Like there’s this measure of gender dysphoria but typically it’s been, uhm, binary. So there’s like an FTM one and a MTF one. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: And so we’ve reformatted it and changed the language so that it’s non-binary and that anybody can take it where there’s like a body image scale but like you give one to female assigned at birth people and one to male assigned at birth people but we took all that out so that it’s just like— 
AJ: Just one. 
KS: Right. Yeah. 
AJ: One sort of measure. 
KS: Right. A non-binary kind of approach to thinking about things and separating out bodies from gender identities. 
AJ: What’s the current measure though? So how, how, how, currently, uhm, how do people sort of, uhm, figure out who they are based on this measure? 
KS: Oh, well I don’t know if people figure out who they are based on that measurement. [Laughs]. 
AJ: Okay. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: I mean there, there’s certain measures, like so, if like, if I brought in like all the measures that we have right now, uhm, there are some that I give to people, like sort of when they come, after their first meeting. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Uhm, which is really, I mean, gosh, I don’t know. It would be interesting to ask other people who are doing it before how they do it because this is like my model that I’ve done like— So Walter Bockting was the director before me and so I changed everything after he left. So we like [laughs]… 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: … which he knows [laughs]. 
AJ: So you’re the new Walter Bockting. 
KS: Yeah. [Laughs]. And I changed it and he was like, “I want you to change everything after I leave.” And I was like, “Okay.” So like I changed everything. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: But so of those measures, uhm, you know, I think it helps people articulate like how they feel about their— like the gender dysphoria stuff is like— but uh how uh it like— people probably come in at different point about this, like an awareness of how uncomfortable is it to have certain pronouns used with— or like how uncomfortable you feel with like anatomic dysphoria… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Like naming genital dysphoria or secondary sex characteristics like discomfort and like to what level that is. Uhm, you know, like, what it’s like to be perceived as male or as female in the world because the world is pretty binary and so how that feels. And if you feel like you are on the binary like kind of naming that or if you feel like your gender is— like somewhere on the spectrum like how that all fills out. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: So I don’t think those measures help people. [Laughs]. 
AJ: I mean, they don’t help the person but it seemingly helps the helping profession… 
KS: I mean it helps— 
AJ: … figure out something, right? 
KS: Right. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: Like am I going to give this person hormones or we don’t think you are… 
KS: I mean, I think it’s not, I don’t, I think that’s the old model is maybe like there would be like a cutoff. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: I have no idea. 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: That seems awful. I mean what happens now is people come in and they kind of have a sense of what they want or what they don’t want. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Or they’re like, “I’m not exactly sure what I want, and I want to talk through what I want.” And so that measure might be like, “Oh, wow. I didn’t realize that I actually feel really upset about these things because I don’t— I try not to think about my body. I feel pretty disassociated from it but when you made me think about this like I realized that I really want this. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Or, you know, “I read the informed consent about like the side effects of hormones” but most people have already done copious internet research before coming in. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: So it’s not like I’m telling them anything they don’t know. 
AJ: Right. Yeah. 
KS: Uhm, especially teens. Uhm, but, you know, so I think, if anything, like therapy now like the way we kind of see it here is like supporting someone like on their journey and figuring out like who they are and what they want. I’m not telling anybody who they are. 
AJ: Yes, mhm. 
KS: I really adamantly do not see my role that way. 
AJ: Yeah, and that’s perfectly, uhm, understandable. It, it does seem like that was the, the case when the Harry, Harry Benjamin standards of care… 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: … were, uhm, in place like— Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: And people still come in kind of wanting that. Like people want an answer like, “Why am I trans?” 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Or, “I want you to tell me if I am or not. Should I transition or not?” 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: And it’s like, you know, I can’t answer those questions. I can tell you about people’s experiences or like what I’ve seen, you know. But I can’t tell you like, you know, and my answer to like why is just that I, you know, I believe being trans is just part of the natural sort of gender spectrum of humanity, you know. There’s cis people, there’s trans people. Like, there’s people with blue eyes and brown eyes, you know. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Like, that’s just, like it’s part of who we are. 
AJ: So you don’t, so in some instances or cases, uhm, is there like some medical, hormonal imbalances that effect, you know? 
KS: They’ve done some— so that’s not like my, yeah, they’ve done some research but it’s sort of, like looking at sort of brain stuff… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … and like exposure to different hormones and, uhm, it’s like there isn’t sort of any conclusive, like this is what it is. You know, like just like there, like the gay gene was a thing for a while. You know, yeah. 
AJ: Right, right. 
KS: So there’s no conclusive like evidence over time that, like, you know, shows oh it’s this like little part of the DNA that means that you’re gonna be whatever, you know. So, as far as I know there isn’t anything that sort of proves that in that way. 
AJ: Sure. Yeah. No, I, I, and I don’t think there is either. I just know that, you know, a lot— I’ve been out for twenty-five years as a transgender woman so I’ve talked to a lot of transgender people over time and some people rely on, “Yeah, I had low testosterone so constantly. I was…” 
KS: Oh yeah. 
AJ: And they use, sort of use that medical mode to explain their transness. Maybe it’s something that’s helpful for them as an individual or they feel like it makes them more, uhm, makes people more empathetic to their plight… Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: Right. 
AJ: … in, in public, uh, but, uhm, but I agree with you. I don’t think there is any one particular explanation for why this occurs in nature. 
KS: Mhm. 
AJ: Uhm, but, uhm, you mentioned, you know, you’re the, the new Walter Bockting, or at least I said that anyway. 
KS: Right. [Laughs]. 
AJ: But you replaced, you replaced, uhm, Dr. Walter Bockting who, who had actually become pretty world renowned in terms of transgender health and particularly around HIV and AIDs research and prevention and care. Uhm, how does your work differ from, from that particular focus? Uhm, yeah, and then I got some other follow up questions 
KS: Sure, yeah. Uhm, well I think, mh, I don’t know, I would have to think about our tr
AJectories. I mean, like when… so I started my postdoc here in like 2007 and Walter was the director. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And, uhm, you know, when I came in I [laughs] I think Walter had so much patience for me. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: Cause I was sort of, I was like an activist and I was like really critical of things. 
AJ: Yeah, right. [Laughs]. 
KS: Uhm, and I think sometimes Walter is like kind of misunderstood in that. He’s had like some pretty radical ideas or he’s like made a lot of change like in like WPATH and just in trans health research and also just talking about like transgender identity as identity and not as, uh, pathology and like talking about minority stress and all these things. I think he’s like kind of misunderstood in the Twin Cities. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: And then like yeah, he’s definitely the leading researcher like in the world on like trans health stuff. Uhm, that’s, I hear that everywhere I go. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: So anyway… Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: And, and I just, I, I know, I apologize because we’re doing this on tape and I just, so you threw out the term WPATH and… 
KS: Oh sorry. The world— 
AJ: The world may not know what that is… 
KS: The world… 
AJ: … so I’m just going to stop you. I gotta be the interviewer. 
KS: Oh, no. It’s okay. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: The World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Yes. 
AJ: Which sort of replaced the Harry Benjamin… 
KS: Harry Benjamin. 
AJ: … Association. 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: And Mr. Benjamin’s standards of care. 
KS: Right, so the WPATH, like the current version came out in 2011. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: It’s version seven. 
AJ: Version seven. 
KS: Mhm. 
AJ: And that is sort of the prescriptive process that a physician or a therapist should take in treating a transgender, uhm, or treating a person with, what’s the current language? 
KS: Gender dysphoria. 
AJ: Gender dysphoria. 
KS: Yeah. So, uhm, it, it has guidelines for practitioners so mental health practitioners, uhm, physicians, surgeons, uhm, there’s guidelines for like voice therapy, uhm, all of that. And it also sets the standard for, I mean, it’s across the whole world but in the U.S. it’s a very useful Dr. Katie Spencer Interview document for insurance access coverage because it says that, uhm, surgery and hormones and, I mean, uh, like electrolysis, even though that’s not covered, but… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … that those things are medically necessary and so this whole movement that’s been happening… [Alarms go off in building]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: Is that us? [Alarms stop]. No okay. The, this whole movement that’s been happening the last few years about like expanding insurance access and coverage, you know, has been really… The current WPATH standards of care have been really helpful. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: But anyway so Walter, the difference between us, I think, is that I came in more, uhm, you know, it’s generational. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: So I was like sort of shaped by like my community and like the value systems around that. Uhm, you know, and that I’m more of a psychotherapist and more of a clinician. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: So I’ve been like less interested in research and more interested in reshaping like our clinical program. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: Uhm, but I think what I was talking about now about like sort of our model and the lifespan approach, uhm, is being shaped by the clinical work that we’re doing here and the needs of the population. And so now I feel like we’re trying to build a really strong like clinically based research program that’s based on psychotherapy so. 
AJ: Hm. Well, uhm, no that’s really fascinating. So how, about on average, so what kind of programming in sexuality, uhm, this was I believe the second, uhm, center for transgender therapy in the nation. 
KS: That’s the word on the street… 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: … that we were… that John Hopkins was the first. 
AJ: Right. Uhuh. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: And we were the second. Yeah. 
AJ: Uhm, you came in 2007. 
KS: Yes. Mhm. 
AJ: How, how many transgender or gender questioning, uhm, people do you think you guys see here on an average basis and, uhm, how has the field expanded, just locally, uhm, beyond the program in human sexuality? So are there other services similar to, uhm, PHS that are happening throughout the, the metropolitan area? 
KS: Yeah, uhm, gosh, so we see, I mean, I don’t know. We’d have to look at— we’re the second largest program here so we have four different programs. So there’s our General Relationship and Sex Therapy program. 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: And then the Trans Health program is the second largest one. 
AJ: Oh wow. 
KS: Uhm, we currently have, like, a six to nine-month waitlist to get in… 
AJ: [Gasps]. Wow. 
KS: … in our adult program. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: And then our Child and Adolescent program, which is, you know, as young as, I mean I think the youngest people that come here are like five, four or five. Uhm… 
AJ: Really? 
KS: Yeah… to eighteen. Uhm, that has a year plus waitlist. Especially, there’s just a complete dearth of providers for people like kind of fifteen and under. Like people will work with fifteen, sixteen, seventeen-year olds but like twelve year olds there’s only like, like maybe three providers in the cities that work with like younger than twelve. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: Uhm, but so in, combine like, in the Child and Adolescent and Adult programs, I mean, I don’t know, I mean like uh at least, I was like, how many people do I see a week? 
AJ: [Laughs]. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: I see like close to thirty people a week. That’s not even counting group so I mean how many people we have engaged in services at the time, probably like a hundred and fifty uh between you know. 
AJ: Really? 
KS: Oh my god, yeah. Totally. 
AJ: With a six to nine-month waiting list for adults. 
KS: Yeah, and we’re not the only one. I mean like… Okay so yeah that’s our whole Trans Health program so that’s child, teens, adults… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And that’s people, it’s not just people coming in and being like, “I want to transition.” There’s people who are exploring their gender. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: There’s people who are like maybe coming in that just need a secondary letter or like a letter for surgery. Like we do couple’s therapy for people. We work with families and parents and partners so it’s like the whole, all the stuff. 
AJ: The whole spectrum. 
KS: And then there’s people who come just for hormone therapy with Dr. Feldman so she’s our medical provider and she does hormone therapy. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: Uhm, so there’s different prov— so there’s like, in the Twin Cities we have a really broad network so there’s people in private practice that have trans clients and therapists. Uhm, and then we have a few different places where people can get hormone therapy. So there’s Deb Thorp and Park Nicollet. There’s Smiley's Clinic which they’re seeing a ton of people which is part of the Fairview system. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: Uhm, and then there’s Family Tree Clinic that’s starting to see people. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: And then there’s a few others, sort of endocrinologists or primary care physicians that do some hormone therapy. 
AJ: Wow. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: Yeah, and then there’s a couple of surgeons that do like breast augmentation and chest surgery but we don’t have anybody, the closest surgeon we have that does bottom surgery is in Chicago. 
AJ: Okay. And bottom surgery means… 
KS: [Laughs] genital surgery, gender confirmation surgery… 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: … below the belt surgery, you know. [Laughs]. 
AJ: [Laughs]. No. 
KS: People call it all sorts of things. Some people still call it SRS, Sex Reassignment Surgery. 
AJ: Sexually Reassignment Surgery, yeah. 
KS: But the current term is gender confirmation surgery. 
AJ: Which we heard last night at the Oscars. I don’t know if you watch… 
KS: Oh, I didn’t see that! 
AJ: … the Oscars but uh… 
KS: No! 
AJ: … as they were introducing Eddie Rain, Redmayne, the, the star of the movie the Danish Girl, uhm, they introduced the film as uh the first person to undergo gender confirmation surgery. 
KS: Wow. 
AJ: Uh, so I thought that was kind of interesting… 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: … sort of politically uh relevant term to use on the big stage like the Oscars. 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: Uhm, so and I’m just really curious, is the, what, do you think that this sort of, uhm, explosion [laughs] of transgender identified, transgender questioning, trans— or gender concerned people… 
KS: Mhm. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: … uhm, is a result that this is a new phenomenon that is happening or is it more this has been happening a long time and people are becoming more comfortable, uhm, or less afraid to express their transgender identity? 
KS: Yeah. Well it’s interesting. I mean to go back to what you said a while ago too about, uhm, you know, people who see like kind of a biological basis for understanding like their trans identity… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … I mean, I think a really big mistake that people often make is that the trans community is like this holistic, unified like one identity, you know, everybody understands our identity in one way. 
AJ: Sure. Uhuh. 
KS: And I think, you know, there’s a lot of generational differences. There, there’s so many differences around like how people understand that. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Uhm, and so I’ve really seen that generationally like younger people like teens, uhm, yeah, they have a totally different context, you know, so like the, the fluency that a lot of teens have around naming their sexual identity, their romantic attraction from their emotional attraction to their sexual attraction to their gender identity to their expression. Like they just, you know, like people are talking about that and posting about that. There’s like, part of that is about the internet… 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: … and like how teens use that and how they connect with other people and can talk to people in Australia about like their gender stuff, you know? 
AJ: Right. Uhuh. 
KS: And that just wasn’t available to people like from, in the eighties or the nineties or you know. 
AJ: Right. Yeah. Absolutely. 
KS: So that’s a big thing. I mean I think our society has changed a lot and there’s just a lot more information available to people and connectivity. I mean I think the internet has been like a huge thing and like connecting queer trans people to each other like across the world. 
AJ: Absolutely. Yeah. 
KS: So having that ability to have more connection and discourse about identity and build on each other’s ideas of that and more expansiveness around gender and sexuality as a whole. 
AJ: Mhm. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: So, no I don’t think it’s like something that didn’t exist before and now does but I do think that the language available to us then also changes how we think about ourselves and then how we relate. You know so it’s all, I don’t know if you could pull apart like how that all happens within society but yeah… 
AJ: Sure. Uh, wow, you said that you guys work with young people. As young as five. 
KS: Right. 
AJ: And I know you said earlier that you don’t personally, uhm, work with that young of a, of, uhm, of a client but I’m wondering what do you see as the, the trends in, uhm, in transgender health? And, uhm, as people are coming out younger and younger what are the expectations for transgender identity as we know it today? 
KS: Woah. 
AJ: Does that make sense? 
KS: What are the expectations? Hmm. Yeah, I have, okay, well, hold on, let me start with the, the themes. So, I mean, the theme, I think a big theme is that there are more young people accessing services. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And so when, when I talk about little kids, like, yeah, so I don’t work with the little kids but I, I do know that the little kids work that we are doing here is usually parents who are coming in and being like, you know, so, “My kid is gender non-conforming in some way.” Or, “My kid is like, you know, saying that they identify as a boy or they identify as a girl,” and, you know, having questions about, so it’s like working with the family. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: Uhm, and then I think that there is a couple different, there’s some questions about that. So there’s a movement to have early social transition. So having little kids like socially transition before puberty, uhm, and then you can start puberty suppression or puberty blocking hormones… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … uhm, that, you know, prevent sort of your pubertal development and then you can start, uhm, hormones, you know, around like fifteen or so. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And then, so you don’t have to go through the trauma of puberty in your birth assigned sex. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Uh, so that’s like one movement. And then there’s another movement that says that well you should wait ‘til puberty happens before socially transitioning because a lot of people maybe are gender non-conforming but they might not be trans identified like after puberty. 
AJ: UHuh. 
KS: So that’s uh, that’s a theme and a trend and people are discussing that everywhere. 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: Uhm, and then also just working with teens on puberty suppression and starting hormones and how that changes your experience. So for me… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … as a therapist like a lot of my teens are talking about like navigating like dating and they, you know, so nobody really knows they’re trans cause they socially transitioned maybe around puberty. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: And so how do you navigate that with your body or talk about your gender history or, you know, just how you’ve experienced the world cause you’ve experienced the world really differently versus transitioning when you’re thirty or forty, you know? 
AJ: Which is part of my question I was trying to get at. What are the expectations, right? 
KS: Oh, yeah. 
AJ: Cause now, now you haven’t had that sort of traumatic life changing experience of, you know, going through the world as one gender and, and now suddenly thirty-two years later or even eighteen years later. 
KS: Right, right. 
AJ: Making a— 
KS: But just going through that whole adolescence, yeah. Mhm. 
AJ: Right, as your sort of chosen or… 
KS: Felt. Felt is the word that people use. 
AJ: Felt! Okay. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: [Laughs]. Felt. Felt gender. Your felt gender. 
AJ: Felt gender, thank you for that term. [Laughs]. Cause it gets confusing to me as a, as a person, because the landscape is rapidly shifting and changing. 
KS: Right. 
AJ: Uhm, so that’s fascinating that, uhm, these young people won’t necessarily have to have those sort of traumatic experiences. They come through completely sort of socialized as their felt gender and able to navigate the world, uhm, for the most part as such and, and really the tricky issues has become more intimate with relationships is what I hear you saying. 
KS: I think it really depends just like I think anybody any age like some people are more trans identified and some people are more like feel distant from that identity. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Uhm, and I do think like your context and your social experience interacts with that. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Uhm, but yeah I, I it’s different. There’s different components of it but I think, you know, people still have to navigate like that part of themselves, you know. Not just intimate but, yeah, but also then they walk the world. 
AJ: There’s an internal piece, uhuh. 
KS: Right, yeah. So it’s like the internal and the external and that can look different for everybody like there’s different combinations of that. And I think just also people’s sense of like how they experience transphobia and trans negativity, trans misogyny, you know, like, uh, having a consciousness around all of those different parts. You know, like if you’re aware of that, like if you feel like that you’re identified with transness or if you’re not identified with transness and how that interacts with the self. 
AJ: Hm. 
KS: Those are all themes that people are talking about. 
AJ: Wow. 
KS: Yeah. [Laughs]. 
AJ: So Katie, you know, this is, this is our last question, uhm, you have sort of, uhm, identified yourself as a, as an activist [laughs]. An activist therapist. Uhm. 
KS: [Laughs]. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: [Laughs]. Like an activist judge kind of…[Laughs]. 
KS: [Laughs].God yeah. I, I definitely have like a queer agenda. [Laughs]. 
AJ: Uhm, so that is my question. You know, uhm, what is the transgender agenda in your mind? Uh, and, uhm, where do you see the trans community in fifty years? 
KS: [Laughs]. Oh. Oh, no. I’m gonna give you like, I mean [takes deep breath], you know, I think that this is, I’m gonna give an answer just partially for myself and I’m sorry I’m sort of thinking this out. 
AJ: Mhm. That’s fine. That’s perfect. [Laughs]. 
KS: Uhm, well first of all like as, as a cis person I don’t think it’s like my job to [laughs] say what the trans agenda is but I will say as someone who is in an ally ship and like really passionate about that… I mean part of it is, I think that there’s like a practical aspect of that and like navigating the world, like the world that we currently live in. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Like insurance access is really important. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: You know, and, but I think that there’s activists like questions around like what does that mean. So if there’s like a medical model narrative around like trans bodies and trans identity… 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: … does that like, you know, sort of reinforce this binary idea. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: Uhm, but like that theory doesn’t really translate to like people’s practical experiences. Like people just need access to the things that they need. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: And different people need different things, you know, so, I think for me what is important to me is to affirm, you know, people’s experiences of themselves and help them like get what they need in the world. So my vision would be, or I feel like, you know, in the next fifty years is that, you know, people could access what they need easily. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: That like it would be less pathologizing, that, uhm, you know… Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: Mhm. [Buzzer goes off]. Sorry. 
KS: We’d have like more economic justice, more racial justice, more gender justice. You know, that all of those things would come true, but all of those systems are interlocking. I don’t think we can just change one like trans people can’t exist without like, well, everybody, you know, like there’s trans people of color, there’s white trans people, there’s poor trans people, there’s rich trans people, like… 
AJ: Right. 
KS: … we can’t just work on like something without like affecting all of those different systems interlocking. 
AJ: Huh. Wow. [Laughs]. 
KS: [Laughs]. 
AJ: This is a great conversation. One, one last thing though that… 
KS: [Laughs]. 
AJ: … I know I said this was the last question but you talked about this, uhm, this work group that you worked with, uhm… 
KS: Oh the Insurance Task Force. 
AJ: The Insurance Task Force, and, and you guys had some pretty significant accomplishments. Uhm, who were they? What did you guys accomplish? And, and how is that going to impact the, the future of the community? 
KS: Well, what happened, I mean, the way, so what happened is that I went to the UCSF, the University of California, San Francisco, uhm, Transgender Health Excellence Conference. 
AJ: Okay. 
KS: Uh, I guess a year ago. It was a year ago. Last April. It happens every two years. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Uhm, and there were several people from the National Center for Transgender Equality, uhm, Transgender Law Center. People were talking about how they had gotten insurance access at the state level in Oregon and California and so they were activists. They were talking about how they did it, how they worked within there. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: So I was like, “We do that in Minnesota.” [Laughs]. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
AJ: Uhuh, okay. 
KS: So I came back and I like called Phil Duran and like called Dylan Flunker at the Rainbow Health Initiative. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: And Phil works at OutFront Minnesota. And then we just set up a meeting and then we invited, uhm, there’s like a listserv of providers in town. So like I contacted, I reached out to specific people like Janet Bicer at Reclaim. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: And Xavier Schmitz at the Family Partnership. And Dep Thorp at Park Nicollet. Like people who have been doing work for a long time. 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: Uhm, and so we had a set of meetings over several months and then somebody, I think it was Rox, uh, Roxanne Anderson at, who works at OutFront and with the Transgender Health Coalition, had a connection with someone who works in Keith Ellison’s office [coughs] and Nicky Leingang. 
AJ: Mhm. 
KS: And so Nicky started coming to meetings and was working at Ellison’s office and then Ellison pushed on the Commerce Department to give us a meeting. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: Cause Dylan and Phil and I had already been working on them for a while but it helps to have like a politician… 
AJ: Sure. 
KS: … use some of their influence. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: Uhm, and so then we were able to put together sort of like a policy and kind of ask like, “This is what we need you to do.” 
AJ: Right. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: Uhm, and then they agreed to do it. So they put it in front of the governor I guess and, you know, agreed to like change the Commerce Department. Like put out this, uhm, oh gosh, it’s like an insurance bulletin. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: So insurance like regulatory agencies like put out these bulletins that say like, “You have to cover these medications for this diagnosis.” 
AJ: Mhm. Sure. 
KS: And so that’s what they had to do to say that this is medically necessary. 
AJ: Wow. 
KS: So, yeah. 
AJ: Congratulations. 
KS: Yeah! It’s so great and there’s all these other things happening right now too. Like, you know, we’re hoping to overturn the MA ban, like there’s a lot of— 
AJ: What’s the MA ban? 
KS: Uhm… 
AJ: Medical Assistance or? 
KS: So Medical Assistance has, since the, uh, well… So Minnesota was one of the first states to cover surgery. 
AJ: Right. 
KS: Gender confirmation surgery. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: And then some person, like some legislature [laughs]… 
AJ: [Laughs]. 
KS: Some legislature, uh, I guess in the ‘90s. I forget what year it was so this was before my time. Uhm, but, you know, they decided to like ban it so they wouldn’t cover any surgeries. 
AJ: Mhm. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: And then there was like a grandfather clause so if you could prove that you had treatment before like 1997 or ’95, I forget what year it was, then you could get surgery covered if you had Medical Assistance. 
AJ: Mm. Mhm. 
KS: Uhm, but then they cut off all of those in 2005. Anyways so they finally had been waiting for a good case and a good time to try to push it through. So they have a person who is suing the state of Minnesota. So it’s OutFront, the ACLU, like different kind, or, uhm, putting together this, uhm, you know, challenge together. 
AJ: Uhuh. 
KS: And I’m serving as like an expert witness for it just to be like this is a medically necessary treatment. 
AJ: Wow. 
KS: Uhm, but I haven’t had to do anything yet. I just know that I’m supposed to do that. [Laughs]. 
AJ: When it, when the time comes. [Laughs]. 
KS: So hopefully that will all happen and the Affordable Care Act so there’s all this stuff around like insurance happening right now. Like, you know, federal agencies have to cover surgery and hormones and therapy now so it’s all moving in that direction. Huge changes are happening. 
AJ: Huge changes, positive changes. 
KS: Yeah. 
AJ: Uhm, and, and you representing, uhm, The Center for Sexual Health Program in Human Sexuality have been at the center of that. 
KS: Sure. [Laughs]. Yeah. 
AJ: Thank you, Katie, for this, uhm, great conversation and for sharing a little bit of your own personal, uhm, stories as well as more a broad story of what’s going on… 
KS: Both/and. [Laughs]. 
AJ: … at PHS today. Uhm, I really appreciate it and, uhm, look forward to, to talking to you again. Before I leave your office, I’m just gonna [moves camera]… 
KS: Oh, pan around. 
AJ: Pan around. Dr. Katie Spencer Interview 
KS: [Laughs]. 
AJ: And take a few images of some of the artwork, uh, that we talked about, uhm, the gender octopus, uh, [laughs]… 
KS: [Laughs]. 
AJ: … and some of the other drawings that you said some of your young people have made. 
KS: Wait, those are supposed to be coconuts up at the top. [Laughs]. 
AJ: Oh, really? Okay. [Laughs]. And they identify what? 
KS: Uhm, I mean, you know, different teams, these were all done in group so like there’s people who identify as like genderqueer, as like trans, as, you know, just… 
AJ: Wow. So, uhm, the notion of what is gender is, is really, uh, expanding. 
KS: Oh totally. 
AJ: Uhm, and absolutely, uhm, changing the world as we know it. 
KS: Mhm, yep. 
AJ: Thank you, Katie. 
KS: Yeah. My pleasure. 
AJ: Alright. 
KS: [Laughs].
